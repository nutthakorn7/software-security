# How to Do & Submit Work

**Platforms:** **Google Classroom** (worksheets, reports, grades) + **GitHub** (your code fixes).
All offensive work is on the provided sandbox targets only — see [ETHICS.md](ETHICS.md).

---

## One-time setup (Week 1)
1. Create a GitHub account; **fork** the course repo to your account.
2. `git clone` your fork; stand up the environment (Docker, VM, Burp) per Week 1 Lab 0.
3. Join the Google Classroom (code given in class).

## Weekly LAB — how to do & submit

**Do it:**
1. In your fork, create a branch `wk<NN>` (e.g. `wk04`).
2. Stand up the week's target: `docker compose up` (or the command in that lab's README).
3. Work through the **worksheet** (`labs/week<NN>…/worksheet.md`): for each task record the **payload/command**, a **screenshot** of the result, and a **2–3 sentence mitigation**.
4. For the **Defend / fix** task: edit the code, **commit to your `wk<NN>` branch**, and note the **commit hash** in the worksheet.

**Submit (two parts):**
| Part | Where | What |
|------|-------|------|
| Worksheet | **Google Classroom** | the completed worksheet exported to **PDF** (screenshots embedded) |
| Code fix | **GitHub** | push branch `wk<NN>`, open a PR (or paste the commit link in the worksheet + Classroom) |

**File name:** `Wk<NN>_<StudentID>.pdf`  (e.g. `Wk04_65123456.pdf`)
**Deadline:** before the next class session (unless told otherwise).
**Grading:** the 100-pt rubric in each worksheet (Lecture Qs 20 / Tasks+evidence 40 / Defense 25 / Reflection 15).

## QUIZ — how it works
- **Online via Google Form** (link posted in Classroom at quiz time).
- **When:** last 30 min of **Week 6** (Quiz 1) and **Week 15** (Quiz 2).
- **Format:** 15 questions — 10 MCQ (auto-graded) + 3 short answer + 2 applied (instructor-graded). 25 pts, 30 min, **individual, closed book**.
- No separate file to submit — the Form **is** the submission.

---

## EXAMS
| Exam | How submitted |
|------|---------------|
| W8 Midterm written | on paper / Google Form in class (120 min) |
| W9 Midterm CTF | submit **flags + payload + mitigation** via the CTF Form/Classroom (150 min) |
| W18 Final written | on paper / Google Form (150 min) |
| W19 Final CTF + demo | flags via Form; live project demo (graded by rubric) |

## TERM PROJECT
- Report: fill [project/REPORT-TEMPLATE.md](project/REPORT-TEMPLATE.md) → export PDF → **Google Classroom**.
- Code + SBOM + signed artifact + CI pipeline: in the team's **GitHub** repo (link in the report).
- Milestones per [project/README.md](project/README.md).

---

## Rules for every submission
- **Name + Student ID** on every file; teamwork only where stated (labs/quizzes/exams are individual).
- **AI-tool disclosure:** state how you used any AI tool (search, code, translate) — a section is built into the worksheet/report.
- **Late:** score deduction per the syllabus; submit what you have.

## Academic Integrity & Anti-Cheating

This is a security course — we practice the same rigor on your own work. The following controls are in place; assume your submission is checked.

- **Your flags are unique to you.** Each student receives **personalized CTF/lab flags** derived from your student ID. A flag is traceable to the person it was issued to — submitting someone else's flag is detected automatically and counts as a violation for **both** parties.
- **Your screenshots must show you.** Evidence must include your **terminal `whoami` / login email / student ID** and a **timestamp**. Generic or borrowed screenshots are not accepted.
- **Your code is attributable.** Work in **your own GitHub fork** with your own commits. Submissions are run through **code-similarity tools (MOSS/JPlag)** against classmates and previous cohorts. A single "paste-everything" commit with no history is a red flag.
- **Quizzes** are individual, time-limited, one attempt, locked to your `@kmitl.ac.th` account, with shuffled questions/options.
- **Random live checks.** You may be asked to **reproduce a task or explain your fix live**. Answers you can't explain in your own words score zero.
- **Explain, don't copy.** Reflection questions are graded on *your* reasoning about *your* results.

**Allowed:** discussing concepts, helping a classmate debug their *own* setup, using AI tools **if disclosed**.
**Not allowed:** sharing flags/answers/code, submitting another's screenshots, copying a report.

Violations follow the [ethics & academic-integrity policy](ETHICS.md) and KOSEN's conduct process.
