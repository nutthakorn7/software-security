"""Deliberately INSECURE — Week 14 AI / LLM Security. Sandbox only; for authorized lab use.

No external LLM/API needed: mock_llm() is a tiny local, rule-based "model" that
behaves like a naive system-prompt-concatenating chatbot so prompt injection works
fully offline.

Flaws (OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025):
  LLM01 Prompt Injection          — user text can override the system instructions.
  LLM02 Sensitive Info Disclosure — the secret flag lives in the prompt and leaks.
  LLM05 Improper Output Handling  — model output is rendered into HTML UNESCAPED (XSS).

Run:  flask --app vulnerable_chatbot run --port 6000   (or use docker-compose.yml)
