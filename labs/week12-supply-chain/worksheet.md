# Worksheet 12 — Software Supply-Chain Security (3 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · Week 12
> **Aligned:** OWASP 2025 — A03 Software Supply Chain Failures · A08 Software or Data Integrity Failures · **CWE:** CWE-1104, CWE-829, CWE-1357, CWE-1395
> **Signature game:** 📦 Dependency Confusion Heist
>
> **Ethics note:** This lab has **no live private/public registry to attack** — the dependency-confusion exercise is a controlled walkthrough (`dependency-confusion.md`) plus the interactive resolver simulation in Task 2, not a real package pull. **Never** plant or publish look-alike packages on the real PyPI or npm — that is an attack on every downstream user, and nothing in this lab requires it.

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions

1. Explain **dependency confusion** (substitution). Why does a public `acme-internal-utils==99.0.0` win over a private `==1.4.0` when a resolver shops both indexes?
2. How does **typosquatting** (`reqeusts`, `urlib3`) achieve code execution *at install time* before any of your code runs?
3. What is an **SBOM** (CycloneDX/SPDX) and why is it a prerequisite for both incident response and SLSA provenance?
4. Sigstore **keyless** signing uses Fulcio (CA) + Rekor (transparency log) tied to an OIDC identity. Why is that safer than a long-lived private key (CWE-321)?
5. Summarize the **SLSA** levels. Which level does "signed artifact + SBOM + provenance gate before deploy" put you at, and what is still missing?

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (150 min)

**Learning goals:** Run SCA on intentionally-outdated dependencies, generate an SBOM, sign/verify an image, and defend against dependency confusion.

**Prerequisites:** Docker; the lab folder (`requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `app.py`, `sca_scan.sh`, `sign.sh`). For signing: browser for the OIDC flow + registry push access.

**Environment setup**
```bash
cd labs/week12-supply-chain
bash sca_scan.sh                 # trivy fs + pip-audit on requirements.txt (+ optional image scan)
docker build -t week12-supplychain:lab .
bash sign.sh week12-supplychain:lab   # CycloneDX SBOM -> sbom.cdx.json, then cosign sign + verify
```

**What to submit per task:** the exact command(s) + output, a screenshot, and a 2–3 sentence remediation note mapping the finding to A03/A08 or the CWE.

### Task 0 — Onboarding (15 min)
Read `requirements.txt` and list the pinned packages with their versions. Note why they are intentionally outdated (each is deliberately an old release so SCA tools flag its known CVEs).
**Deliverable:** the package/version table + which OWASP/CWE this maps to.

### Task 1 — SCA scan: build the remediation worklist (35 min)
**Goal:** Flag the known-vulnerable dependencies — A03.
**Steps:**
1. `bash sca_scan.sh` — read the `trivy fs` table (CVE, installed vs. fixed version) and the `pip-audit` advisory IDs (GHSA-/PYSEC-).
2. Pick three findings; record CVE/advisory id, severity, and the fixed version.
**Deliverable:** the SCA output + a 3-row remediation table (package → current → fixed).

### Task 2 — Dependency Confusion Heist (35 min)
**Goal:** Watch the wrong package win — A03 / CWE-1357.

**Reality check:** this lab does **not** stand up a live private/public registry. `acme-internal-utils` is
a worked example, not an installable package — there is nothing to actually `pip install` here (the name
doesn't exist on real PyPI either, so don't expect that to work as a shortcut). Task 2 is a controlled
walkthrough of the resolver's own rule, using the simulation below, which computes the real
"highest version wins" logic live instead of just asserting the outcome.

```sim
resolver-confusion
```

**Steps:**
1. Read `dependency-confusion.md`'s "Dependency confusion (substitution)" section for the mechanism.
2. In the simulation, load the **"the attack"** preset (private `1.4.0`, public `99.0.0`, merged /
   `--extra-index-url` mode) and record which index the resolver picks and why.
3. Keep the same version numbers and switch to the **single-index** (`--index-url`) mode; record how the
   verdict changes — this is the resolver behavior Task 4's "single trusted index" defense relies on.
4. Try the **"win the race"** preset (private version numerically higher than public) and note why the
   sim's own explanation calls that "not a defense."

**Deliverable:** a screenshot of the simulation's verdict in both index modes (merged vs. single) for the
same version pair, plus one sentence on why an attacker defeats the "keep my internal version number high"
idea.

### Task 3 — SBOM + signing/verification (30 min)
**Goal:** Produce a component inventory and prove integrity — A08.
**Steps:**
1. After `bash sign.sh week12-supplychain:lab`, open `sbom.cdx.json` and find Flask's entry.
2. Read the `cosign verify` PASS for the signed image.
3. Negative test on an unsigned image (it **must** fail):
   `cosign verify --certificate-identity-regexp '.*' --certificate-oidc-issuer-regexp '.*' python:3.9-slim`
   → `Error: no signatures found`. (Both `--certificate-identity*` flags are required in keyless mode; without
   them cosign stops at `Error: --certificate-identity or --certificate-identity-regexp is required` — a usage
   error, which is *not* the same thing as proving the image is unsigned.)
**Deliverable:** the SBOM Flask component entry + the verify PASS + the negative-test failure.

### Task 4 — Defend / fix it (35 min)
**Goal:** Stop dependency confusion and lock integrity — defenses from `dependency-confusion.md` + `sign.sh`.
**Steps:**
1. **Pin + hashes:** run `pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt` against this lab's own
   `requirements.txt` (it has no hashes yet) and record pip's refusal — `ERROR: Hashes are required in
   --require-hashes mode...` plus the `--hash=sha256:…` line pip prints for you. That refusal is the same
   mechanism that would block a real confusion substitution: once hashes are required, a package that
   doesn't match — from *either* index — cannot install silently.
2. **Single trusted index:** use one `--index-url` instead of `--extra-index-url`; explain why the resolver stops shopping around (tie this back to Task 2's single-index verdict).
3. **Namespace scoping:** describe reserving/namespacing the internal package name.
4. **Provenance gate:** state how the `cosign verify` from `sign.sh` becomes a gate before a simulated deploy.
**Deliverable:** the `--require-hashes` refusal output (step 1) + the simulation's before/after verdict for merged vs. single index (from Task 2) + the one defense you found most effective and why.

## Part 4 — Reflection

1. **Mapping:** table — finding | tool (`sca_scan.sh` / `sign.sh`) | OWASP 2025 id | CWE | fix.
2. **Real breach:** analyze the **XZ Utils backdoor (CVE-2024-3094)**. Which OWASP/CWE applies, and would an SBOM + signing + provenance gate have caught a maliciously-modified upstream dependency? (Compare with SolarWinds or Log4Shell if useful.)
3. **Best mitigation + SLSA self-assessment:** one paragraph — which SLSA level your defenses reach and why, and the single highest-leverage control for your team.

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show a terminal running `printf '%s | %s | ' "$(whoami)" '<YOUR-STUDENT-ID>'; date '+%F %T %Z'` **in the
  same image as the evidence**. When the evidence is a browser page, a DevTools panel or a
  rendered response, put that terminal **beside the browser and capture the whole screen** — a
  cropped window carries nothing that identifies you, and the lab's own output is
  byte-identical for the whole cohort *by design*, so the stamp is the only thing that makes
  the shot yours. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. How to submit: **learn.zcr.ai/submit** (full guide: [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md)).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?

## 🤖 Audit the AI (required)

AI is a power tool you must **distrust** — you are graded on your *critique*, not the AI's answer.

1. Ask an AI assistant to exploit **or** fix this week's vulnerability. Paste its full answer.
2. **Find what's wrong or risky** in it — insecure code, a subtly incomplete fix, a hallucinated API/function/CVE, a missed edge case, or wrong reasoning. Quote the exact line(s).
3. Produce the **correct, verified** version yourself and explain in 2–3 sentences why the AI's output was insufficient.

> Disclose your AI use in the Part 1 table. This task counts toward your **Defense + Reflection** score.

## 🧠 Comprehension & Prompt (required)

**A. Explain in Plain English (EiPE).** In 2–3 sentences, in your own words, describe what this week's vulnerable code/endpoint actually *does* and *why it is exploitable* — explain the mechanism, don't dump jargon.

**B. Prompt Problem.** Write a **single prompt** that makes an AI produce a *correct, secure* fix for one finding. Run it: does the exploit now fail? If not, refine the prompt and try again. Submit the **final prompt + the verified result**.
*Graded on the prompt's precision and your verification — this trains problem decomposition and AI literacy (Denny et al. 2024).*
