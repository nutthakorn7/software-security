# Worksheet 12 — Software Supply-Chain Security (3 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · Week 12
> **Aligned:** OWASP 2025 — A03 Software Supply Chain Failures · A08 Software or Data Integrity Failures · **CWE:** CWE-1104, CWE-829, CWE-1357, CWE-1395
> **Signature game:** 📦 Dependency Confusion Heist
>
> **Ethics note:** The dependency-confusion / typosquat exercise runs **only against the instructor-provided private registry in the isolated lab network** (`dependency-confusion.md`). **Never** plant or publish look-alike packages on the real PyPI or npm — that is an attack on every downstream user.

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions

1. Explain **dependency confusion** (substitution). Why does a public `acme-internal-utils==99.0.0` win over a private `==1.4.0` when a resolver shops both indexes?
2. How does **typosquatting** (`reqeusts`, `urlib3`) achieve code execution *at install time* before any of your code runs?
3. What is an **SBOM** (CycloneDX/SPDX) and why is it a prerequisite for both incident response and SLSA provenance?
4. Sigstore **keyless** signing uses Fulcio (CA) + Rekor (transparency log) tied to an OIDC identity. Why is that safer than a long-lived private key (CWE-321)?
5. Summarize the **SLSA** levels. Which level does "signed artifact + SBOM + provenance gate before deploy" put you at, and what is still missing?

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (150 min)

**Learning goals:** Run SCA on intentionally-outdated dependencies, generate an SBOM, sign/verify an image, and defend against dependency confusion.

**Prerequisites:** Docker; the lab folder (`requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `app.py`, `sca_scan.sh`, `sign.sh`). For signing: browser for the OIDC flow + registry push access.

**Environment setup**
```bash
cd labs/week12-supply-chain
bash sca_scan.sh                 # trivy fs + pip-audit on requirements.txt (+ optional image scan)
docker build -t week12-supplychain:lab .
bash sign.sh week12-supplychain:lab   # CycloneDX SBOM -> sbom.cdx.json, then cosign sign + verify
```

**What to submit per task:** the exact command(s) + output, a screenshot, and a 2–3 sentence remediation note mapping the finding to A03/A08 or the CWE.

### Task 0 — Onboarding (15 min)
Read `requirements.txt` and list the six pinned packages with their versions (Flask 0.12.2, Werkzeug 0.14.1, Jinja2 2.10, requests 2.19.1, urllib3 1.24.1, PyYAML 3.13). Note why they are intentionally outdated.
**Deliverable:** the package/version table + which OWASP/CWE this maps to.

### Task 1 — SCA scan: build the remediation worklist (35 min)
**Goal:** Flag the known-vulnerable dependencies — A03.
**Steps:**
1. `bash sca_scan.sh` — read the `trivy fs` table (CVE, installed vs. fixed version) and the `pip-audit` advisory IDs (GHSA-/PYSEC-).
2. Pick three findings; record CVE/advisory id, severity, and the fixed version.
**Deliverable:** the SCA output + a 3-row remediation table (package → current → fixed).

### Task 2 — Dependency Confusion Heist (35 min)
**Goal:** Watch the wrong package win — A03 / CWE-1357.
**Steps (against the lab's private + "public" indexes, per `dependency-confusion.md`):**
1. `pip install -v acme-internal-utils` and note the source URL/version served.
2. Re-resolve so the higher-versioned public look-alike (`==99.0.0`) wins; observe the `PWNED.txt` marker proving install-time code ran.
**Deliverable:** the source URL/version before vs. after confusion + the marker proof.

### Task 3 — SBOM + signing/verification (30 min)
**Goal:** Produce a component inventory and prove integrity — A08.
**Steps:**
1. After `bash sign.sh week12-supplychain:lab`, open `sbom.cdx.json` and find Flask's entry.
2. Read the `cosign verify` PASS for the signed image.
3. Negative test: `cosign verify python:3.9-slim` — confirm "no matching signatures" (unsigned **must** fail).
**Deliverable:** the SBOM Flask component entry + the verify PASS + the negative-test failure.

### Task 4 — Defend / fix it (35 min)
**Goal:** Stop dependency confusion and lock integrity — defenses from `dependency-confusion.md` + `sign.sh`.
**Steps:**
1. **Pin + hashes:** convert to `pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt` (or a committed lockfile); re-run Task 2 step 2 and show a hash mismatch blocks the substitution.
2. **Single trusted index:** use one `--index-url` instead of `--extra-index-url`; explain why the resolver stops shopping around.
3. **Namespace scoping:** describe reserving/namespacing the internal package name.
4. **Provenance gate:** state how the `cosign verify` from `sign.sh` becomes a gate before a simulated deploy.
**Deliverable:** before/after of which registry served the package + the one defense you found most effective and why.

## Part 4 — Reflection

1. **Mapping:** table — finding | tool (`sca_scan.sh` / `sign.sh`) | OWASP 2025 id | CWE | fix.
2. **Real breach:** analyze the **XZ Utils backdoor (CVE-2024-3094)**. Which OWASP/CWE applies, and would an SBOM + signing + provenance gate have caught a maliciously-modified upstream dependency? (Compare with SolarWinds or Log4Shell if useful.)
3. **Best mitigation + SLSA self-assessment:** one paragraph — which SLSA level your defenses reach and why, and the single highest-leverage control for your team.

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show your **`whoami` / login email / student ID** and a **timestamp**. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. See [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?

---

## 🤖 Audit the AI (required)

AI is a power tool you must **distrust** — you are graded on your *critique*, not the AI's answer.

1. Ask an AI assistant to exploit **or** fix this week's vulnerability. Paste its full answer.
2. **Find what's wrong or risky** in it — insecure code, a subtly incomplete fix, a hallucinated API/function/CVE, a missed edge case, or wrong reasoning. Quote the exact line(s).
3. Produce the **correct, verified** version yourself and explain in 2–3 sentences why the AI's output was insufficient.

> Disclose your AI use in the Part 1 table. This task counts toward your **Defense + Reflection** score.

## 🧠 Comprehension & Prompt (required)

**A. Explain in Plain English (EiPE).** In 2–3 sentences, in your own words, describe what this week's vulnerable code/endpoint actually *does* and *why it is exploitable* — explain the mechanism, don't dump jargon.

**B. Prompt Problem.** Write a **single prompt** that makes an AI produce a *correct, secure* fix for one finding. Run it: does the exploit now fail? If not, refine the prompt and try again. Submit the **final prompt + the verified result**.
*Graded on the prompt's precision and your verification — this trains problem decomposition and AI literacy (Denny et al. 2024).*
