# Worksheet 5 — Cross-Site Scripting & Client-Side Risks (3 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · **Week 5**
> **Aligned:** OWASP 2025 **A05 Injection** · **CWE-79** (XSS), **CWE-352** (CSRF), **CWE-1004** (cookie without HttpOnly)
> **Signature game:** ⛳ **XSS Golf** — fire `alert(1)` in the fewest characters possible. Lower payload length = lower score = better. Par for reflected is the `<img>` vector; can you go under par?

> ⚠️ **Ethics note:** Use only the provided `vulnerable_app.py` sandbox and your own Juice Shop container. Stealing real users' cookies or sessions is illegal. All "session theft" steps here target the sandbox cookie `session=abc123` only.

## Part 1 — Student Information

| Name | Student ID | Date | Group |
|------|-----------|------|-------|
|      |           |      |       |

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions

Answer in 2–4 sentences each.

1. Distinguish **reflected**, **stored**, and **DOM-based** XSS by *where* the untrusted data is injected and *when* it executes. Which two does our `vulnerable_app.py` implement, and at which routes?
2. How does **contextual output encoding** (`markupsafe.escape`) stop `<script>` from executing? Why is HTML-context encoding different from JavaScript- or URL-context encoding?
3. Explain how a strict **Content-Security-Policy** (`script-src 'self'`) defeats an *injected* inline script even when encoding is missing.
4. What do the cookie flags **HttpOnly**, **SameSite**, and **Secure** each protect against? Map each to a concrete attack (cookie theft via XSS, CSRF, network sniffing).
5. Why does **CSRF** (CWE-352) work even without any script injection, and how does `SameSite=Strict` plus the same-origin policy blunt it?

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (150 min)

**Learning goals:** land reflected + stored XSS, abuse a JS-readable cookie, build a CSRF PoC against the comment board, then prove `fixed_app.py` blocks all of it.

**Prerequisites:** Docker + Docker Compose, a browser with DevTools, a text editor. Working dir: `labs/week05-xss-client-side/`.

### Environment setup

```bash
cd labs/week05-xss-client-side
docker compose up            # python:3.12-slim + flask, runs vulnerable_app.py
# vulnerable app -> http://localhost:5000   (service name: xss-lab, port 5000)
```
Optional secondary target (for DOM XSS, which our app does not expose):
```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop       # -> http://localhost:3000
```

**What to submit per task:** the exact **payload**, a **screenshot** of the alert/effect, and a **2–3 sentence mitigation**.

---

**Task 0 — Onboarding (5 min).** Browse `http://localhost:5000/`. Open DevTools → Application → Cookies and confirm `session=abc123` is set with **no HttpOnly / SameSite**. Screenshot it. *Deliverable: screenshot.*

**Task 1 — Reflected XSS + XSS Golf (30 min) ⛳.**
- *Goal:* execute JS via `/hello`, then minimize the payload.
- *Steps:* visit `/hello?name=<script>alert(1)</script>`, then the shorter `/hello?name=<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`. Record each payload's character count for your golf score.
- *Deliverable:* both payloads + char counts + screenshot of `alert(1)` + your lowest score.

**Task 2 — Stored XSS (30 min) ⛳.**
- *Goal:* persist a script that runs for every visitor of `/comments`.
- *Steps:* POST a comment with body `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` (use the form or `curl -d 'body=...'`). Reload `/comments` and watch the cookie pop.
- *Deliverable:* payload + screenshot of the alert showing `session=abc123` + why stored XSS is more dangerous than reflected.

**Task 3 — Cookie theft via XSS (25 min).**
- *Goal:* show the cookie is readable by injected JS because **HttpOnly is missing** (CWE-1004).
- *Steps:* store `<script>new Image().src='http://localhost:5000/hello?name='+document.cookie</script>` (a beacon), or simply `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`. Observe the cookie value being exfiltrated/displayed.
- *Deliverable:* payload + screenshot + 2–3 sentences on how HttpOnly would have stopped this.

**Task 4 — CSRF PoC (30 min).**
- *Goal:* make a third-party page force a state-changing POST to `/comments`.
- *Steps:* create a local `csrf.html` with an auto-submitting form targeting the board (no token exists, cookie has no SameSite, so the browser attaches `session` cross-site):
  ```html
  <body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
    <form action="http://localhost:5000/comments" method="POST">
      <input name="body" value="CSRF posted this comment">
    </form>
  </body>
  ```
  Open the file and confirm the comment appears on `/comments`.
- *Deliverable:* the HTML + screenshot of the forged comment + why `SameSite=Strict` blocks it.

**Task 5 — Defend / fix it (30 min) 🛡️.**
- *Goal:* prove `fixed_app.py` blocks Tasks 1–4.
- *Steps:* stop the vulnerable container (`Ctrl-C`), then:
  ```bash
  docker compose run --rm --service-ports xss-lab python fixed_app.py
  ```
  Re-fire each payload. Expected: `/hello` renders the script **as text** (escape, L21), stored comments render literally (Jinja autoescape, L30–33), the injected inline script is **blocked by CSP** (L12, check DevTools console), and the cookie now has `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Secure` (L42) so the CSRF cookie is no longer attached cross-site.
- *Deliverable:* screenshots of escaped output + the CSP console error + the hardened cookie flags.

## Part 4 — Reflection

1. **CWE/OWASP mapping:** map your reflected/stored XSS to **CWE-79** and your CSRF PoC to **CWE-352**, both under OWASP 2025 **A05 Injection** (CSRF historically A01/A05).
2. **Real breach:** the **2018 British Airways breach** (~380k payment records) used malicious JavaScript (Magecart) injected into the site to skim card data — a client-side script-injection failure. In 3–4 sentences relate it to this lab's XSS and CSP lessons.
3. **Best mitigation:** between output encoding, a strict CSP, and HttpOnly+SameSite cookies, which gives the broadest defense-in-depth, and why is "encoding alone" still risky?

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show your **`whoami` / login email / student ID** and a **timestamp**. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. See [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?

## 🤖 Audit the AI (required)

AI is a power tool you must **distrust** — you are graded on your *critique*, not the AI's answer.

1. Ask an AI assistant to exploit **or** fix this week's vulnerability. Paste its full answer.
2. **Find what's wrong or risky** in it — insecure code, a subtly incomplete fix, a hallucinated API/function/CVE, a missed edge case, or wrong reasoning. Quote the exact line(s).
3. Produce the **correct, verified** version yourself and explain in 2–3 sentences why the AI's output was insufficient.

> Disclose your AI use in the Part 1 table. This task counts toward your **Defense + Reflection** score.
