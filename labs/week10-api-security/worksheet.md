# Worksheet 10 — API Security (3 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · Week 10
> **Aligned:** OWASP API Security Top 10:2023 — API1 BOLA · API3 Broken Object Property Level Auth (Mass Assignment) · API4 Unrestricted Resource Consumption
> **Signature game:** 🥷 crAPI Raid
>
> **Ethics note:** Run exploits **only** against the lab targets shipped here (`vulnerable_api.py` on `:5000`) or your own OWASP crAPI instance. Never test BOLA, mass assignment, or brute-force against systems you do not own or are not explicitly authorized to test.

## Part 1 — Student Information

| Name | Student ID | Date | Group |
|------|-----------|------|-------|
|      |           |      |       |

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions

1. Define **BOLA (API1:2023)**. Why is it the #1 API risk, and why can't a WAF reliably stop it?
2. What is **mass assignment / broken object property level authorization (API3:2023)**? Contrast a blocklist vs. an allow-list of bindable fields.
3. **API4:2023** is unrestricted resource consumption. Give two distinct impacts (security and availability) of an unthrottled `/api/login`.
4. In `vulnerable_api.py`, `current_user()` trusts the `X-User-Id` header. Why is a client-supplied header NOT authentication, and what should replace it?
5. Why does object-level authorization have to be checked **per request, per object** rather than once at login?

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (145 min)

**Learning goals:** Exploit BOLA, mass assignment, and a missing rate limit against a live API; then read the secure version and explain each fix.

**Prerequisites:** Docker + Docker Compose, `curl`. (Optional bonus: cloned OWASP crAPI.)

**Environment setup**
```bash
cd labs/week10-api-security
docker compose up         # INSECURE API on :5000, SECURE API on :5001
# Seeded users: alice(id 1) bob(id 2) carol(id 3, admin, balance 9999)
```

**What to submit per task:** the exact command(s) + raw response/HTTP status, a screenshot, and a 2–3 sentence mitigation note mapping the bug to its OWASP API id.

### Task 0 — Onboarding (15 min)
Confirm both APIs respond: `curl http://localhost:5000/` and `curl http://localhost:5001/`. Note which port is insecure. Record the three seeded users.
**Deliverable:** both root responses + the user table.

### Task 1 — BOLA: read another user's orders (35 min)
**Goal:** Read carol's (admin) orders without being carol — API1:2023.
**Steps:**
1. `curl http://localhost:5000/api/users/3/orders` — note you receive the "Server rack" order with no auth.
2. Iterate the id: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/users/2/orders`.
3. On the secure API observe the ladder: `curl -i http://localhost:5001/api/users/3/orders` (401), `curl -i -H "X-User-Id: 1" http://localhost:5001/api/users/3/orders` (403), `curl -i -H "X-User-Id: 1" http://localhost:5001/api/users/1/orders` (200).
**Deliverable:** the leaked order JSON + the 401/403/200 transcript + mitigation note.

### Task 2 — Mass assignment: self-promote to admin (30 min)
**Goal:** Smuggle `is_admin` + `balance` into user creation — API3:2023.
**Steps:**
1. `curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/users -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"mallory","password":"x","is_admin":true,"balance":1000000}'`
2. Confirm the response echoes `"is_admin": true, "balance": 1000000`.
3. Repeat against `:5001` and confirm the smuggled fields are forced to `is_admin:false, balance:0`.
**Deliverable:** both responses side by side + mitigation note (allow-list in `solution_api.py`).

### Task 3 — Unrestricted resource consumption: brute-force login (25 min)
**Goal:** Show `/api/login` has no throttle — API4:2023.
**Steps:**
1. Run the brute-force loop from `attack.md` against `:5000` (guesses incl. `alice123`) — all attempts processed.
2. On `:5001` loop 7 times: `for i in $(seq 1 7); do curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"alice","password":"wrong"}'; done`
3. Confirm the 6th/7th attempt returns `429`.
**Deliverable:** the `401 401 401 401 401 429 429` sequence + mitigation note.

### Task 4 — Bonus: crAPI Raid (optional, 20 min)
Against your own OWASP crAPI instance (`git clone https://github.com/OWASP/crAPI.git`), capture one BOLA or mass-assignment flag.
**Deliverable:** flag + endpoint + which API Top 10 id it maps to.

### Task 5 — Defend / fix it (20 min)
**Goal:** Explain the fixes using the secure reference `solution_api.py`.
**Steps:** Read the three `# --- FIX ...` blocks. For each, quote the line(s) that defeat your Task 1–3 exploit: the per-object ownership check (`caller["id"] != uid and not caller["is_admin"]`), `ALLOWED_CREATE_FIELDS` binding, and the `RATE_LIMIT=5 / RATE_WINDOW=60` limiter.
**Deliverable:** for each of API1/API3/API4 — the exploit that worked on `:5000`, the line in `solution_api.py` that blocks it, and the new HTTP status on `:5001`.

## Part 4 — Reflection

1. **Mapping:** complete a table — finding | endpoint | OWASP API id | fix applied.
2. **Real breach:** research an API authorization breach (e.g., the Optus or T-Mobile BOLA/IDOR incidents). Which API Top 10 id matches, and would the `solution_api.py` ownership check have prevented it?
3. **Best mitigation:** of object-level auth, allow-list binding, and rate limiting — which gives the most risk reduction for an API platform, and why?

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show your **`whoami` / login email / student ID** and a **timestamp**. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. See [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?

## 🤖 Audit the AI (required)

AI is a power tool you must **distrust** — you are graded on your *critique*, not the AI's answer.

1. Ask an AI assistant to exploit **or** fix this week's vulnerability. Paste its full answer.
2. **Find what's wrong or risky** in it — insecure code, a subtly incomplete fix, a hallucinated API/function/CVE, a missed edge case, or wrong reasoning. Quote the exact line(s).
3. Produce the **correct, verified** version yourself and explain in 2–3 sentences why the AI's output was insufficient.

> Disclose your AI use in the Part 1 table. This task counts toward your **Defense + Reflection** score.
