# Worksheet 2 — Secure SDLC & Tooling (3 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · **Week 2**
> **Aligned to:** OWASP 2025 (A03 Injection, A02/A07 secrets & crypto) · CWE-798, CWE-89, CWE-78, CWE-327, CWE-489
> **Signature game:** "Bug Triage Race" (scan → triage; score = true positives − misclassified)

> **Ethics note:** The scanners run only against the provided `vulnerable-repo/` on your own machine. Do not point SAST/secret scanners at third-party repos or production systems without authorization. Treat any secret you find here as fake lab data.

## Part 1 — Student Information
| Name | Student ID | Date | Group |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions
Answer in your own words (2–4 sentences each).
1. Distinguish SAST, DAST, and SCA — what does each see, and when in the SDLC does each run?
2. What is secret scanning, and why do hardcoded secrets keep ending up in repos?
3. What does "shift-left / DevSecOps" mean in practice for a CI pipeline?
4. Why is coverage-guided fuzzing considered the dominant modern bug-finding technique?
5. Define true positive vs. false positive in scanner triage, and why misclassifying both directions is costly.

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (180 min)
**Learning goals:** run a SAST tool and a secret scanner, triage findings by CWE/severity, and remediate real flaws.
**Prerequisites:** Docker installed; internet to pull the Semgrep/Gitleaks images.

**Environment setup**
```bash
cd labs/week02-sdlc-tooling
cat scan.sh                 # see exactly what it runs
bash scan.sh                # Semgrep (p/default + p/owasp-top-ten) then Gitleaks on ./vulnerable-repo
```
Target under scan: `vulnerable-repo/app.py` (plus `requirements.txt`). It contains five planted flaws.

**What to submit per task:** the command/payload run + a screenshot of the finding + a 2–3 sentence mitigation.

**Task 0 — Onboarding (5 min)** · *Goal:* confirm tooling. *Steps:* run `bash scan.sh`; confirm both Semgrep and Gitleaks sections produce output. *Deliverable:* screenshot showing both tools ran.

**Task 1 — SAST sweep with Semgrep (25 min)** · *Goal:* find code flaws. *Steps:* read the Semgrep output; locate the SQL injection in `/user` (CWE-89, string-formatted query), the OS command injection in `/ping` (CWE-78, `shell=True`), the weak `md5` password hash (CWE-327), and `debug=True` (CWE-489). *Deliverable:* one screenshot per finding with the file:line.

**Task 2 — Secret scan with Gitleaks (15 min)** · *Goal:* find leaked credentials. *Steps:* read the Gitleaks output; identify `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `DB_PASSWORD` (CWE-798). *Deliverable:* screenshot + the rule that fired for each.

**Task 3 — Bug Triage Race (30 min)** · *Goal:* triage accurately. *Steps:* build a table with columns *Tool | File:Line | CWE | Severity | TP/FP | Fix idea*; mark at least 3 true positives and 1 likely false positive and justify each. (Score = TP − misclassified.) *Deliverable:* the completed triage table.

**Task 4 — Fuzzing intro (10 min)** · *Goal:* see coverage-guided fuzzing find a bug SAST won't. *Steps:* in the `labs/toolbox` container (Apple clang has no libFuzzer runtime), build and run `clang -g -fsanitize=address,fuzzer harness.c -o fuzz && ./fuzz` against this lab's `harness.c`; it crashes within seconds with an AddressSanitizer heap-buffer-overflow. (The deep fuzzing+exploit lab is Week 11.) *Deliverable:* the ASan crash output (or a screenshot) + a 2-sentence note on why fuzzing finds this bug when a linter/SAST pass over the same 4-line check would not.

**Task 6 — Scan the project target (40 min)** · *Goal:* apply the tools to your term project. *Steps:* run Semgrep + Gitleaks against **NoteVault** (`../../project/starter-app`); also run an SCA scan: `docker run --rm -v "$PWD/../../project/starter-app:/src" aquasec/trivy fs /src`. *Deliverable:* a findings list (tool, file:line/CVE, CWE) — reuse it in your project vuln report.

**Task 7 — Build a security CI gate (25 min)** · *Goal:* automate the scan (previews Week 15). *Steps:* adapt `../week15-devsecops-pipeline/security-ci.yml` into a workflow that runs Semgrep + Trivy + Gitleaks and **fails on HIGH/CRITICAL**; run it locally (`act`) or commit to your fork and read the Actions log. *Deliverable:* the workflow file + a screenshot of a failing run.

**Task 8 — SAST blind spots (20 min)** · *Goal:* see what scanners miss. *Steps:* find one real bug in `vulnerable-repo/app.py` (or NoteVault) that Semgrep did **not** flag, and explain why a pattern-based tool missed it. *Deliverable:* the bug + a 2-sentence explanation.

**Task 5 — Defend / fix it (10 min)** · *Goal:* remediate the planted flaws in `vulnerable-repo/app.py`. *Steps:* rewrite `/user` to use a parameterized query (`?` placeholder); remove `shell=True` and pass an argument list in `/ping`; move both secrets to environment variables; replace `md5` with bcrypt/argon2; set `debug=False`. *Deliverable:* a before/after diff for each fix mapped to its CWE.

## Part 4 — Reflection
1. Map two of your findings to their CWE and to the matching OWASP 2025 category.
2. Name a real-world breach caused by a hardcoded/leaked secret or an injection flaw, and what control would have caught it pre-release.
3. Which single tool (SAST vs. secret scanning) gave the highest-value findings on this repo, and why?

## Grading rubric (100)
| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| Lecture questions (Part 2) | 20 |
| Exploitation + evidence (scan output + triage table + screenshots) | 40 |
| Defense (remediated `app.py` with before/after diffs) | 25 |
| Reflection (CWE/OWASP mapping + breach + tool value) | 15 |

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show your **`whoami` / login email / student ID** and a **timestamp**. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. See [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?

## 🤖 Audit the AI (required)

AI is a power tool you must **distrust** — you are graded on your *critique*, not the AI's answer.

1. Ask an AI assistant to exploit **or** fix this week's vulnerability. Paste its full answer.
2. **Find what's wrong or risky** in it — insecure code, a subtly incomplete fix, a hallucinated API/function/CVE, a missed edge case, or wrong reasoning. Quote the exact line(s).
3. Produce the **correct, verified** version yourself and explain in 2–3 sentences why the AI's output was insufficient.

> Disclose your AI use in the Part 1 table. This task counts toward your **Defense + Reflection** score.

## 🧠 Comprehension & Prompt (required)

**A. Explain in Plain English (EiPE).** In 2–3 sentences, in your own words, describe what this week's vulnerable code/endpoint actually *does* and *why it is exploitable* — explain the mechanism, don't dump jargon.

**B. Prompt Problem.** Write a **single prompt** that makes an AI produce a *correct, secure* fix for one finding. Run it: does the exploit now fail? If not, refine the prompt and try again. Submit the **final prompt + the verified result**.
*Graded on the prompt's precision and your verification — this trains problem decomposition and AI literacy (Denny et al. 2024).*
