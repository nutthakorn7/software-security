# Worksheet 2 — Secure SDLC & Tooling (3 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · **Week 2**
> **Aligned to:** OWASP 2025 (A03 Injection, A02/A07 secrets & crypto) · CWE-798, CWE-89, CWE-78, CWE-327, CWE-489
> **Signature game:** "Bug Triage Race" (scan → triage; score = true positives − misclassified)

> **Ethics note:** The scanners run only against the provided `vulnerable-repo/` on your own machine. Do not point SAST/secret scanners at third-party repos or production systems without authorization. Treat any secret you find here as fake lab data.

## Part 1 — Student Information
| Name | Student ID | Date | Group |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions
Answer in your own words (2–4 sentences each).
1. Distinguish SAST, DAST, and SCA — what does each see, and when in the SDLC does each run?
2. What is secret scanning, and why do hardcoded secrets keep ending up in repos?
3. What does "shift-left / DevSecOps" mean in practice for a CI pipeline?
4. Why is coverage-guided fuzzing considered the dominant modern bug-finding technique?
5. Define true positive vs. false positive in scanner triage, and why misclassifying both directions is costly.

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (95 min)
**Learning goals:** run a SAST tool and a secret scanner, triage findings by CWE/severity, and remediate real flaws.
**Prerequisites:** Docker installed; internet to pull the Semgrep/Gitleaks images.

**Environment setup**
```bash
cd labs/week02-sdlc-tooling
cat scan.sh                 # see exactly what it runs
bash scan.sh                # Semgrep (p/default + p/owasp-top-ten) then Gitleaks on ./vulnerable-repo
```
Target under scan: `vulnerable-repo/app.py` (plus `requirements.txt`). It contains five planted flaws.

**What to submit per task:** the command/payload run + a screenshot of the finding + a 2–3 sentence mitigation.

**Task 0 — Onboarding (5 min)** · *Goal:* confirm tooling. *Steps:* run `bash scan.sh`; confirm both Semgrep and Gitleaks sections produce output. *Deliverable:* screenshot showing both tools ran.

**Task 1 — SAST sweep with Semgrep (25 min)** · *Goal:* find code flaws. *Steps:* read the Semgrep output; locate the SQL injection in `/user` (CWE-89, string-formatted query), the OS command injection in `/ping` (CWE-78, `shell=True`), the weak `md5` password hash (CWE-327), and `debug=True` (CWE-489). *Deliverable:* one screenshot per finding with the file:line.

**Task 2 — Secret scan with Gitleaks (15 min)** · *Goal:* find leaked credentials. *Steps:* read the Gitleaks output; identify `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `DB_PASSWORD` (CWE-798). *Deliverable:* screenshot + the rule that fired for each.

**Task 3 — Bug Triage Race (30 min)** · *Goal:* triage accurately. *Steps:* build a table with columns *Tool | File:Line | CWE | Severity | TP/FP | Fix idea*; mark at least 3 true positives and 1 likely false positive and justify each. (Score = TP − misclassified.) *Deliverable:* the completed triage table.

**Task 4 — Fuzzing intro (10 min)** · *Goal:* understand coverage-guided fuzzing conceptually. *Steps:* read the libFuzzer reference in the README; if the instructor provides a `harness.c`, build and run `clang -fsanitize=address,fuzzer harness.c -o fuzz && ./fuzz` and capture one crash. (No local harness ships with this lab; the deep fuzzing lab is Week 11.) *Deliverable:* a 2-sentence note on why fuzzing finds bugs SAST misses, plus a crash screenshot if a harness was provided.

**Task 5 — Defend / fix it (10 min)** · *Goal:* remediate the planted flaws in `vulnerable-repo/app.py`. *Steps:* rewrite `/user` to use a parameterized query (`?` placeholder); remove `shell=True` and pass an argument list in `/ping`; move both secrets to environment variables; replace `md5` with bcrypt/argon2; set `debug=False`. *Deliverable:* a before/after diff for each fix mapped to its CWE.

## Part 4 — Reflection
1. Map two of your findings to their CWE and to the matching OWASP 2025 category.
2. Name a real-world breach caused by a hardcoded/leaked secret or an injection flaw, and what control would have caught it pre-release.
3. Which single tool (SAST vs. secret scanning) gave the highest-value findings on this repo, and why?

## Grading rubric (100)
| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| Lecture questions (Part 2) | 20 |
| Exploitation + evidence (scan output + triage table + screenshots) | 40 |
| Defense (remediated `app.py` with before/after diffs) | 25 |
| Reflection (CWE/OWASP mapping + breach + tool value) | 15 |

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show your **`whoami` / login email / student ID** and a **timestamp**. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. See [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?
