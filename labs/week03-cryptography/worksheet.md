# Worksheet 3 — Cryptography Used Correctly (and Misused) (3 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · **Week 3**
> **Aligned to:** OWASP 2025 A04 Cryptographic Failures · CWE-327, CWE-916, CWE-330, CWE-798
> **Signature game:** "Capture the Hash" (recover plaintext from weak hashes)

> **Ethics note:** Crack only the hashes provided in `hashes.txt` on your own machine. Password-cracking against accounts or systems you don't own is illegal. Wordlists and recovered values stay inside the lab VM.

## Part 1 — Student Information
| Name | Student ID | Date | Group |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions
Answer in your own words (2–4 sentences each).
1. Distinguish hashing, encryption, and encoding — and give one job each is the wrong tool for.
2. Why is a fast hash like MD5/SHA-1 a bad choice for storing passwords, and what should be used instead?
3. What is a salt, what attack does it defeat, and why must it be unique per password?
4. Why does AES-ECB leak structure, and what does an authenticated mode like AES-GCM add?
5. What's the difference between `random` and a CSPRNG (e.g. `secrets`), and where does it matter?

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (95 min)
**Learning goals:** exploit four crypto misuses, then remediate them with a vetted KDF, authenticated encryption, and a CSPRNG.
**Prerequisites:** Docker (or local Python 3.12); `hashcat` or `john`; the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

**Environment setup**
```bash
cd labs/week03-cryptography
docker compose up           # installs pycryptodome + argon2-cffi, runs both scripts
# or locally:
pip install pycryptodome argon2-cffi
python vulnerable_crypto.py # see the md5 hash, repeated ECB blocks, 6-digit token
```
Targets: `vulnerable_crypto.py` (the misuses), `hashes.txt` (four unsalted MD5s), and `solution_skeleton.py` (the fix).

**What to submit per task:** the command/payload run + a screenshot of the result + a 2–3 sentence mitigation.

**Task 0 — Onboarding (5 min)** · *Goal:* see the misuse output. *Steps:* run `python vulnerable_crypto.py`; note the md5 digest, the identical ECB ciphertext blocks, and the short token. *Deliverable:* screenshot of the program output.

**Task 1 — Capture the Hash (30 min)** · *Goal:* recover the passwords. *Steps:* strip the comment lines from `hashes.txt`, then run `hashcat -m 0 hashes.txt rockyou.txt` (or the `john --format=raw-md5` equivalent); recover all four plaintexts. *Deliverable:* screenshot of the cracked results (mask any real-looking value). Note in one line why unsalted MD5 fell so fast (CWE-916/327).

**Task 2 — ECB structure leak (20 min)** · *Goal:* prove ECB leaks. *Steps:* call `encrypt_ecb(b"A"*16 + b"A"*16)` from `vulnerable_crypto.py` and show the two 16-byte ciphertext blocks are identical; explain how this leaks plaintext structure (CWE-327). *Deliverable:* hex output highlighting the repeated block.

**Task 3 — Predictable token (15 min)** · *Goal:* show the reset token is guessable. *Steps:* call `reset_token()` repeatedly; argue why a 6-digit `random` token (10^6 space, non-CSPRNG) is brute-forceable (CWE-330). *Deliverable:* sample tokens + a one-line attack estimate.

**Task 4 — Hardcoded key (5 min)** · *Goal:* identify the key-management flaw. *Steps:* find `HARDCODED_KEY` in `vulnerable_crypto.py`; explain why shipping a key in source is CWE-798. *Deliverable:* the line + a 2-sentence mitigation.

**Task 5 — Defend / fix it (20 min)** · *Goal:* remediate using `solution_skeleton.py`. *Steps:* run `python solution_skeleton.py`; confirm `store_password`/`verify_password` use argon2id (auto-salted), `encrypt_gcm` uses a random 12-byte nonce + auth tag with a key from `ENC_KEY_HEX` env, and `reset_token` uses `secrets`. Map each fix to the CWE it closes. *Deliverable:* before/after table (misuse → fix → CWE closed) + screenshot of the fixed script running.

## Part 4 — Reflection
1. Map each of the four misuses to its CWE and to OWASP A04, in one line each.
2. Name a real-world breach caused by weak password hashing or hardcoded keys, and which fix here would have prevented it.
3. Across all four fixes, which closes the largest real-world risk, and why?

## Grading rubric (100)
| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| Lecture questions (Part 2) | 20 |
| Exploitation + evidence (cracked hashes + ECB/token/key proof + screenshots) | 40 |
| Defense (working `solution_skeleton.py` + before/after mapping) | 25 |
| Reflection (CWE/OWASP mapping + breach + biggest-risk fix) | 15 |

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show your **`whoami` / login email / student ID** and a **timestamp**. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. See [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?
