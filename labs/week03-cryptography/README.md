# Week 3 — Cryptography Used Correctly (and Misused)

**OWASP 2025:** A04 Cryptographic Failures · **CWE:** CWE-327, CWE-916, CWE-330

## ✅ This week — what to do
1. **Before class** — Docker Desktop working (Week 1 *Lab 0*); skim last week's recap.
2. **Lecture (120 min)** — weekly quiz first (~10 min), then the lecture. Slides: `slides/week03.md`.
3. **Lab (180 min)** — play this week's game, then complete **Worksheet 3** (`worksheet.md`, Parts 1–4, incl. *Audit the AI* + *EiPE/Prompt*). Kickoff: `docker compose up`.
4. **Submit** — worksheet PDF → `learn.zcr.ai/submit` · code → GitHub · weekly quiz → `learn.zcr.ai/quiz`. (How: [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md).)
5. **Project** — apply this week's lesson to your [NoteVault project](../../project/README.md) where it fits.

*Time breakdown: [AGENDA.md](../../AGENDA.md). Grading: see the worksheet rubric.*

## Objectives
- Distinguish hashing vs encryption vs encoding.
- Store passwords with a vetted KDF (bcrypt/argon2).
- Recognize crypto misuse: ECB, hardcoded keys, weak RNG, MD5/SHA-1.

## 🔓 Signature game — "Capture the Hash"
1. **Crack weak hashes:** given unsalted MD5 hashes, recover passwords (e.g. `hashcat`/`john` with a wordlist).
2. **ECB oracle:** observe identical plaintext blocks → identical ciphertext; exploit to leak structure.
3. **Remediate:** rewrite the sample service to use argon2id for passwords and AES-GCM (authenticated) for data, with keys from a secrets manager / env (never hardcoded).

Run the completed solution with a fresh development key supplied through the environment:

```bash
export ENC_KEY_HEX="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
docker compose up
```

`solution_skeleton.py` intentionally refuses to run without this variable so that a missing production secret cannot silently become a temporary or hardcoded key.

## Deliverable
Before/after code + a short note on which CWE each change closes.
