# Worksheet 13 — Cloud & Container Security (4 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · Week 13
> **Aligned to:** OWASP 2025 **A02 Security Misconfiguration** · **CWE-732** (incorrect permission assignment), **CWE-16** (configuration), plus CWE-798, CWE-250, CWE-538, CWE-269, CWE-1104
> **Signature game:** 🔍 *Misconfig Hunt* (CloudGoat-style) — each misconfig you find **and** fix = a flag.

> ⚠️ **Ethics note:** All artifacts here are deliberately broken for teaching and are marked *"Sandbox/teaching only; for authorized lab use."* Scan, exploit, and harden **only** these lab files (or systems you own / are authorized to test). Never point Trivy or these techniques at third-party cloud accounts or images without written permission.

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions

Answer in your own words (2–4 sentences each).

1. Explain the **shared-responsibility model**. In `harden.md` it says "the cloud provider secures *of* the cloud; you secure what you put *in* it." Give one concrete example of each side for an S3-backed app.
2. `iam-policy-insecure.json` uses `"Action": "*"` and `"Resource": "*"`. Describe **why this violates least privilege** and map it to CWE-732 vs CWE-269 — what is the difference between the two CWEs here?
3. The insecure Dockerfile bakes `ENV API_TOKEN=sk_live_...`. Explain how an attacker recovers that secret from a shipped image (name the `docker` commands) and why this is **CWE-798 / CWE-200**.
4. Why is `FROM python:latest` (CWE-1104/CWE-16) a security and reproducibility problem, and how does pinning to an `@sha256:` digest fix it?
5. What does a **distroless** base image remove (relative to `python:3.12-slim`), and how does that shrink the attack surface for an RCE or container-escape attacker?

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (180 min)

**Learning goals:** find cloud/container misconfigurations with Trivy, map each to a CWE, and rebuild the IAM policy + Dockerfile to least privilege / hardened so the findings drop.

**Prerequisites:** Docker installed and running; the `week13-cloud-container/` lab folder; internet access to pull `aquasec/trivy:latest`.

### Environment setup (real commands)

```bash
cd labs/week13-cloud-container

# Option A — the provided wrapper (trivy config over Dockerfiles + IAM JSON):
bash scan.sh

# Option B — run Trivy directly:
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" aquasec/trivy:latest config --severity HIGH,CRITICAL /src

# (Optional) build + CVE-scan the hardened image:
docker build -f Dockerfile.hardened -t week13-hardened:lab .
docker run --rm aquasec/trivy:latest image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL week13-hardened:lab
```

**What to submit per task:** the command(s) you ran + the relevant output (finding count or the specific finding line), a screenshot of the Trivy/terminal result, and a 2–3 sentence mitigation explaining *why* the fix reduces risk (cite the CWE).

### Tasks

- **Task 0 — Onboarding (15 min).** Confirm Docker works (`docker version`), run `bash scan.sh`, and record the **baseline finding count** against `Dockerfile.insecure` and `iam-policy-insecure.json`. **Deliverable:** screenshot of the baseline scan.

- **Task 1 — Misconfig Hunt: container image (40 min).** *Goal:* find every defect in `Dockerfile.insecure`. *Steps:* read each `# DEFECT:` comment, then locate the matching Trivy finding (unpinned `:latest`, secrets in `ENV`, `COPY . .`, `chmod -R 777`, runs as root, unpinned `pip install`). Build a table: defect → CWE → Trivy rule/severity. *Deliverable:* completed table (6 rows) using the IDs from `harden.md`.

- **Task 2 — Misconfig Hunt: IAM (30 min).** *Goal:* document why `iam-policy-insecure.json` is full-admin. *Steps:* identify the `Action:*` / `Resource:*` / no-`Condition` problems; map to CWE-269 / CWE-732. *Deliverable:* 3-row table + one sentence on the blast radius if these creds leak.

- **Task 3 — Secrets & storage (25 min).** *Goal:* show secrets must not live in the image. *Steps:* explain how `ENV API_TOKEN` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are exposed via `docker history`; propose where they belong instead (secrets manager / mounted secret / orchestrator secret per `harden.md`). *Deliverable:* 2–3 sentence remediation + the `.dockerignore` entries you would add to stop `COPY . .` leaking `.git`/`.env` (CWE-538).

- **Task 4 — Hardened-Dockerfile + least-priv-IAM defense (50 min).** *Goal:* prove the "after" is clean. *Steps:* (a) re-run `bash scan.sh` (or `trivy config`) against `Dockerfile.hardened` and `iam-policy-leastpriv.json` and capture the **reduced** finding count; (b) for the Dockerfile, point to the fix for each Task-1 defect (digest pin, multi-stage venv, distroless runtime, `USER 65532:65532`, no secrets in `ENV`, copy only `app.py`); (c) for IAM, confirm the rewrite scopes `s3:GetObject` to `arn:aws:s3:::lab-app-bucket/app/*` and adds the `s3:prefix` `Condition`; (d) list the extra runtime flags from `harden.md` (`--read-only`, `--cap-drop ALL`, `--security-opt no-new-privileges`). *Deliverable:* before/after finding counts, the defect→fix mapping, and the diffed policy/Dockerfile with one sentence per fix.

- **Task 5 — Flag tally (20 min).** *Goal:* score the hunt. *Steps:* one flag per misconfig found **and** fixed (6 container + 3 IAM = 9). *Deliverable:* flag count + the single biggest-risk misconfig and why.

## Part 4 — Reflection

1. **Mapping.** For three findings, write the line of the artifact → CWE → OWASP 2025 A02, and the one-line fix.
2. **Real incident.** Briefly describe a real breach caused by a cloud/container misconfiguration (e.g., a public S3 bucket leak, or an over-permissive IAM role). What single control from this lab would have prevented it?
3. **Best mitigation.** Of everything you did, which control gives the most risk reduction per unit of effort, and why? Argue for least-privilege IAM vs. distroless+non-root.
