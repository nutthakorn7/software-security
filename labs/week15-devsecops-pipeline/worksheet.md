# Worksheet 15 — DevSecOps: Putting It Together (4 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · Week 15
> **Aligned to:** OWASP 2025 **A09 Security Logging & Alerting Failures** · **A10 Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions** (scanners also cover A02/A03) · **CWE-636** (fail open), CWE-532 (logging sensitive data), CWE-209, CWE-489, CWE-798
> **Signature game:** 🔴🔵 *Break the Build* (Red vs Blue) — Blue scores per catch, Red scores per bypass.

> ⚠️ **Ethics note:** The pipeline and `sample-service.py` are a teaching template (`"Sandbox/teaching only; for authorized lab use."`). Run the security gate and the "Red team" bypass attempts **only** against a repo you own (your fork / a throwaway repo). Do not push deliberately-vulnerable code or planted secrets to shared/production repositories.

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions

Answer in your own words (2–4 sentences each).

1. `README-pipeline.md` says each tool runs **twice** (report step, then gate step). Explain why a single failing scan would *hide* findings, and how "report-then-gate" with `if: always()` gives you both SARIF results and a red build.
2. What is the difference between **fail-closed** and **fail-open**? In `sample-service.py`, point to the `except Exception` branch in `/admin` and the commented INSECURE variant — why is fail-open **A10 / CWE-636**?
3. The `permissions:` block in `security-ci.yml` is `contents: read`, `security-events: write`. Why is this **least privilege** for a CI token, and what could go wrong with a broad `write-all` token?
4. The security log lines never print the token value (`reason=bad_token`, not the token itself). Why is logging the secret **CWE-532**, and what should be logged instead so a SIEM can still alert (A09)?
5. Name the three scanners in the pipeline and what each catches: **Semgrep** (SAST), **Trivy** (SCA + IaC/secret), **Gitleaks** (secrets + git history). Which OWASP categories does each map to per the README table?

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (180 min)

**Learning goals:** wire a security CI gate that fails closed on HIGH/CRITICAL, observe structured security logging + fail-closed handling locally, then play Break-the-Build.

**Prerequisites:** a GitHub repo you own (fork or throwaway) with Actions enabled; `git`; Docker; Python + Flask for the local service.

### Environment setup (real commands)

```bash
# --- A) Wire the gate into a repo you own (README-pipeline.md §1) ---
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp labs/week15-devsecops-pipeline/security-ci.yml .github/workflows/security-ci.yml
git add .github/workflows/security-ci.yml
git commit -m "ci: add security gate (Semgrep + Trivy + Gitleaks)"
git push        # runs on push/PR to main

# --- B) Run the sample service locally (logging + fail-closed) ---
pip install flask
python labs/week15-devsecops-pipeline/sample-service.py
# In another shell:
curl -s -X POST localhost:5001/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"token":"nope"}'   # 401 authn_failure
curl -s localhost:5001/admin -H 'Authorization: bob-token'    # 403 authz_failure
curl -s localhost:5001/admin -H 'Authorization: alice-token'  # 200 (admin)
```

**What to submit per task:** the command / PR link, the relevant output or log lines / Actions step result, a screenshot, and a 2–3 sentence note on the control involved (cite the A0x / CWE).

### Tasks

- **Task 0 — Onboarding (15 min).** Run the sample service; trigger the three curls above. **Deliverable:** screenshot of the structured `event=...` security log lines for authn_failure, authz_failure, and authz_success.

- **Task 1 — Logging & fail-closed (35 min, A09/A10).** *Goal:* prove fail-closed behavior. *Steps:* read `/admin` in `sample-service.py`; explain why the broad `except Exception` returns **403, not the secret**, and why `type(exc).__name__` (not the message) is logged (CWE-209). Identify the line that would make it fail *open* (the commented INSECURE variant). *Deliverable:* the log lines + a 2–3 sentence explanation of fail-closed vs fail-open.

- **Task 2 — Stand up the gate (35 min).** *Goal:* get the workflow running. *Steps:* push `security-ci.yml`, open the Actions run, confirm the three jobs (`semgrep`, `trivy`, `gitleaks`) execute and SARIF appears in the Security tab. *Deliverable:* screenshot of the Actions run + the Code scanning alerts page.

- **Task 3 — Blue team: pass the gate (30 min).** *Goal:* a green build. *Steps:* ensure the protected repo has no HIGH/CRITICAL findings and no secrets; fix or justify-and-document any (no blanket-ignore, per README §4). *Deliverable:* link to the passing run.

- **Task 4 — Red team: Break the Build (40 min).** *Goal:* make the gate say **no**. *Steps:* on a branch/PR, inject *one* planted defect (per README §5): an outdated vulnerable dependency (e.g. an old `urllib3`), a `chmod 777` in a Dockerfile, or a hard-coded token. Open the PR and watch the matching gate step fail. *Deliverable:* screenshot of the **failing** gate step + which job caught it (Trivy SCA / Trivy config / Gitleaks) and which `exit-code: "1"` / `--error` step enforced it.

- **Task 5 — Score Break-the-Build (25 min).** *Goal:* tally Red vs Blue. *Steps:* one Blue point per finding the gate caught, one Red point per finding that slipped through; for any bypass, propose the rule that would have caught it. *Deliverable:* scoreboard + one proposed gate improvement.

## Part 4 — Reflection

1. **Mapping.** For three controls you exercised, give: control → A09/A10 (or A02/A03 for a scanner) → CWE → one-line rationale.
2. **Real incident.** Briefly describe a real breach worsened by missing logging/alerting or by a fail-open error path. Which control here would have changed the outcome?
3. **Best mitigation.** Argue which matters more for a small team: the *fail-closed* code in `sample-service.py`, or the *CI gate* in `security-ci.yml` — and why both together beat either alone.

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show your **`whoami` / login email / student ID** and a **timestamp**. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. See [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?
