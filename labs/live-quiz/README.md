# Live Quiz — self-hosted Kahoot-style game

Real-time, host-paced, speed+accuracy-scored MCQ game, reusing the course's existing item banks
(`instructor/quizzes/weekly/item-bank.md` + `instructor/quizzes/review-quiz-item-bank.md`).
Built to remove Kahoot/Quizizz's free-tier player caps as a blocker at N≈120 and to work for
remote/hybrid access (MFU) — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-live-quiz-design.md` for the
full design rationale.

## Run it

```
cd labs/live-quiz && docker compose up --build
```

- Host: open `http://localhost:5050/host`, pick a topic, "Create game" for a PIN.
- Players: open `http://localhost:5050/`, enter the PIN + a pseudonymous nickname (not a real
  name — same PDPA posture as the CTFd scoreboard).

## Deploying for real classroom/remote use

This needs to be reachable outside `localhost` for remote/hybrid students (unlike this course's
other Docker-first labs). Deploy on the existing CTFd challenge-host (already has a public IP +
TLS reverse proxy) rather than standing up new infrastructure — see
`instructor/platform-build/deploy/GO-LIVE-CHECKLIST.md` for that host's setup. Set a real
`SECRET_KEY` via the environment (do not use the `docker-compose.yml` default in production).

## Scoring

Wrong answers always score 0. Correct answers score `1000 * (1 - (time_taken/20) / 2)` — full
marks for an instant answer, half marks for one submitted right at the 20-second limit.

## Data handling

Player nicknames are pseudonymous by design — never map them to a real student roster inside
this tool. Results export as a CSV (`nickname, total_score, correct_count, avg_response_time_ms`)
that the instructor manually joins against the real roster afterward, same as CTFd's flow.

## Relationship to the Kahoot/Quizizz export path

`instructor/quizzes/kahoot/make_kahoot_import.py` (exports to real Kahoot/Quizizz) still exists
and still works — this is a parallel option for when Kahoot's free-tier player cap (~40-50) is
the actual blocker, not a replacement.

## Known limitations (found during build/verification, not blocking)

- **Late answers after a round's results are revealed don't retroactively update that round's
  already-shown leaderboard/distribution**, though the points ARE correctly credited server-side
  and appear in every subsequent round's leaderboard (verified: a late-answering player's score
  was folded correctly into the very next question's broadcast). Only matters if a player answers
  after the 20s timeout or after everyone else has already answered; narrow window, self-heals by
  the next round. Worth a future fix (e.g., disable answer buttons client-side once results are
  shown, or have the server reject/flag post-reveal submissions) but doesn't affect end-of-game
  correctness.
- **CSV export (`/host/<pin>/export`) writes nicknames unescaped.** This is a CSV/spreadsheet
  formula-injection consideration (a nickname starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` could execute as
  a formula if the CSV is opened directly in Excel/Sheets without import sanitization) — separate
  from the innerHTML/XSS class of bug already fixed in `host.js`/`player.js`. Not fixed in this
  build; if the exported CSV is ever opened directly (rather than parsed programmatically), treat
  nickname cells as untrusted and don't trust formula results from them.
- **Production deployment layout is not yet fully specified.** This lab's `docker-compose.yml`
  bind-mounts the real item-bank files via a path relative to the repo root
  (`../../instructor/quizzes/...`), which assumes the repo (with `instructor/` populated) is
  checked out on the CTFd challenge-host with that same relative layout. No existing deploy doc
  (`instructor/platform-build/deploy/GO-LIVE-CHECKLIST.md` and siblings) currently specifies how
  `instructor/quizzes/*` gets synced onto that host, and if the layout assumption is wrong, the
  app currently degrades silently (empty topic dropdown, no error) rather than failing loudly.
  Resolve this — and consider adding a startup warning when the item-bank paths are missing —
  before relying on this in a real class session.
