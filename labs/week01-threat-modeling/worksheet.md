# Worksheet 1 — Security Mindset & Threat Modeling (3 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · **Week 1**
> **Aligned to:** OWASP 2025 A06 Insecure Design · CWE-1059 (design)
> **Signature game:** "Elevation of Privilege" (Microsoft STRIDE card deck)

> **Ethics note:** This week is *modeling only* — you analyze design, you do **not** attack the app. Run the sample app only on your own VM/localhost. Never apply these techniques to systems you do not own or lack written permission to test.

## Part 1 — Student Information
| Name | Student ID | Date | Group |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions
Answer in your own words (2–4 sentences each).
1. Define the CIA triad and give one concrete failure example for each of the three properties.
2. What is a *trust boundary*, and why does data crossing one deserve extra scrutiny?
3. Explain "attack surface." Name two things that increase it in a web app.
4. What does each STRIDE letter map to, and which security property does each threat violate?
5. What does "Secure by Design" (CISA) mean, and how does it differ from bolting security on after release?

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (180 min)
**Learning goals:** build a data-flow diagram (DFD), apply STRIDE to a real Flask app, rank risks, and propose mitigations.
**Prerequisites:** Docker + Docker Compose in your VM; a drawing tool (draw.io / paper + photo); the Elevation of Privilege deck (print or virtual).

**Environment setup**
```bash
cd labs/week01-threat-modeling
docker compose up --build           # starts sample-app on http://localhost:5000
curl -s -X POST localhost:5000/notes -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"owner":"alice","body":"hello"}'   # observe behavior, do not attack
curl -s localhost:5000/notes
```
> 💡 **macOS:** if startup fails with `port 5000 … address already in use`, turn off *System Settings → General → AirDrop & Handoff → AirPlay Receiver*, or run inside the course VM (no conflict).

Source to model lives in `sample-app/app.py`. Template to fill: `THREAT-MODEL-TEMPLATE.md` (copy it, do not edit the original).

**What to submit per task:** the threat/element identified + a screenshot (DFD, table, or running app) + a 2–3 sentence mitigation.

**Task 0 — Onboarding (5 min)** · *Goal:* prove the environment works. *Steps:* `docker compose up`, hit `/notes` and `/files/<name>`, read `sample-app/app.py`. *Deliverable:* screenshot of the running app + the JSON response.

**Task 1 — Draw the DFD (25 min)** · *Goal:* map the system. *Steps:* identify the external entity (web client), the process (Flask app), the data store (`notes.db` SQLite), the `uploads/` store, and the flows for `/notes`, `/upload`, `/files/<name>`; mark the Internet→app trust boundary with a dashed line. *Deliverable:* DFD image embedded in your copy of the template.

**Task 2 — STRIDE the elements (30 min)** · *Goal:* enumerate threats per element. *Steps:* for each element fill the S/T/R/I/D/E grid. Ground it in real code: `/notes` accepts a client-supplied `owner` with no auth (Spoofing); `/upload` saves raw `f.filename` and `/files/<name>` serves it back (Tampering + path-traversal Info disclosure); no logging anywhere (Repudiation). *Deliverable:* completed STRIDE table.

**Task 3 — Elevation of Privilege game (20 min)** · *Goal:* find threats you missed. *Steps:* play the EoP deck against your DFD; each card you can tie to a real element/flow scores a point; record every valid threat. *Deliverable:* list of carded threats + score.

**Task 5 — Abuse cases & attacker personas (20 min)** · *Goal:* think like specific adversaries. *Steps:* define 2 personas (e.g. a curious logged-in user; an anonymous internet attacker) and write 2 abuse cases each against the sample app, tied to DFD elements. *Deliverable:* 4 abuse cases.

**Task 6 — Path-traversal deep-dive (25 min)** · *Goal:* analyze the riskiest flow. *Steps:* trace `/upload` → `/files/<name>`; explain how `../` in a filename escapes `uploads/`; sketch the secure design (`secure_filename`, store outside web root, allow-list extensions). *Deliverable:* the data flow + secure-design note.

**Task 7 — Threat-model the project target (30 min)** · *Goal:* kick off your term project. *Steps:* run **NoteVault** (`cd ../../project/starter-app && docker compose up`), draw a quick DFD, and list the top 3 STRIDE threats you'd investigate. *Deliverable:* NoteVault DFD + top-3 threats (reuse these in your [project report](../../project/REPORT-TEMPLATE.md)).

**Task 8 — Security requirements (15 min)** · *Goal:* turn threats into testable requirements. *Steps:* write 3 security requirements as acceptance criteria ("the system must … so that …"), each mapped to a threat from Task 2 or 7. *Deliverable:* 3 testable security requirements.

**Task 4 — Defend / fix it: rank & mitigate (10 min)** · *Goal:* turn threats into action. *Steps:* rank the top 5 threats by likelihood × impact; propose one concrete mitigation each (e.g., auth on `/notes`, `secure_filename()` + allowlist for `/upload`, request logging for Repudiation, size/rate limits for DoS). *Deliverable:* the top-5 table with mitigations in your template copy.

## Part 4 — Reflection
1. Map your top finding to a CWE and to OWASP A06 (Insecure Design); explain the mapping in one sentence.
2. Name one real-world breach caused by a design flaw (not a missing patch) and what design control would have prevented it.
3. Of your five mitigations, which gives the most risk reduction per unit of effort, and why?

## Grading rubric (100)
| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| Lecture questions (Part 2) | 20 |
| Exploitation + evidence (DFD + STRIDE table + EoP findings + screenshots) | 40 |
| Defense (top-5 ranking + mitigations) | 25 |
| Reflection (CWE/OWASP mapping + breach + best mitigation) | 15 |

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show your **`whoami` / login email / student ID** and a **timestamp**. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. See [SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?

---

## 🤖 Audit the AI (required)

AI is a power tool you must **distrust** — you are graded on your *critique*, not the AI's answer.

1. Ask an AI assistant to exploit **or** fix this week's vulnerability. Paste its full answer.
2. **Find what's wrong or risky** in it — insecure code, a subtly incomplete fix, a hallucinated API/function/CVE, a missed edge case, or wrong reasoning. Quote the exact line(s).
3. Produce the **correct, verified** version yourself and explain in 2–3 sentences why the AI's output was insufficient.

> Disclose your AI use in the Part 1 table. This task counts toward your **Defense + Reflection** score.

## 🧠 Comprehension & Prompt (required)

**A. Explain in Plain English (EiPE).** In 2–3 sentences, in your own words, describe what this week's vulnerable code/endpoint actually *does* and *why it is exploitable* — explain the mechanism, don't dump jargon.

**B. Prompt Problem.** Write a **single prompt** that makes an AI produce a *correct, secure* fix for one finding. Run it: does the exploit now fail? If not, refine the prompt and try again. Submit the **final prompt + the verified result**.
*Graded on the prompt's precision and your verification — this trains problem decomposition and AI literacy (Denny et al. 2024).*
