# Worksheet 1 — Security Mindset & Threat Modeling (3 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · **Week 1**
> **Aligned to:** OWASP 2025 A06 Insecure Design · CWE-501 (Trust Boundary Violation)
> **Signature game:** "Elevation of Privilege" (Microsoft STRIDE card deck)

> **Ethics note:** This week is *modeling only* — you analyze design, you do **not** attack the app. Run the sample app only on your own VM/localhost. Never apply these techniques to systems you do not own or lack written permission to test.

## Part 1 — Student Information
| Name | Student ID | Date | Group | AI use disclosure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sai Shang Hlang | 6631503129 | 15 Aug 2026 | - | I used Codex to review the worksheet, improve the wording, and check the security analysis. I reviewed the resulting explanations against the source code and must capture the final evidence screenshots myself. |

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions
Answer in your own words (2–4 sentences each).
1. Define the CIA triad and give one concrete failure example for each of the three properties.
    - The CIA triad stands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality fails if the app returns Alice's private note to Bob; integrity fails if Bob can change Alice's note without permission; and availability fails if unlimited uploads fill the disk so legitimate users cannot use the app.

2. What is a *trust boundary*, and why does data crossing one deserve extra scrutiny?
    - A trust boundary is a point where data moves between areas with different levels of trust, such as from an Internet user's browser into the Flask application. The receiving side must validate and authorize the data because the sender may be mistaken or malicious.
3. Explain "attack surface." Name two things that increase it in a web app.
    - An attack surface is every reachable place where an attacker can interact with or send data to a system. Adding more public API routes increases it, and adding input features such as file uploads increases it further.
4. What does each STRIDE letter map to, and which security property does each threat violate?
    - **S — Spoofing** violates authentication; **T — Tampering** violates integrity; and **R — Repudiation** violates non-repudiation or accountability. **I — Information Disclosure** violates confidentiality; **D — Denial of Service** violates availability; and **E — Elevation of Privilege** violates authorization.
5. What does "Secure by Design" (CISA) mean, and how does it differ from bolting security on after release?
    - Secure by Design means security requirements and safe defaults are included during design, implementation, and testing. Bolting security on after release reacts to weaknesses after the architecture already exists, which is usually harder, more expensive, and less complete.

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (180 min)
**Learning goals:** build a data-flow diagram (DFD), apply STRIDE to a real Flask app, rank risks, and propose mitigations.
**Prerequisites:** Docker + Docker Compose in your VM; a drawing tool (draw.io / paper + photo); the Elevation of Privilege deck (print or virtual) — free print-and-play PDF at [github.com/adamshostack/eop](https://github.com/adamshostack/eop).

**Environment setup**
```bash
cd labs/week01-threat-modeling
docker compose up --build           # starts sample-app on http://localhost:8080
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/notes -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"owner":"alice","body":"hello"}'   # observe behavior, do not attack
curl -s localhost:8080/notes

echo "demo file" > demo.txt
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/upload -F "file=@demo.txt"   # observe behavior, do not attack
curl -s localhost:8080/files/demo.txt
```

Source to model lives in `sample-app/app.py`. Template to fill: `THREAT-MODEL-TEMPLATE.md` (copy it, do not edit the original).

**What to submit per task:** the threat/element identified + a screenshot (DFD, table, or running app) + a 2–3 sentence mitigation.

**Task 0 — Onboarding (5 min)** · *Goal:* prove the environment works. *Steps:* `docker compose up`, hit `/notes` and `/files/<name>`, read `sample-app/app.py`. *Deliverable:* screenshot of the running app + the JSON response.
  - **Running Application**
![alt text](image-1.png)

  - **JSON Response**
![alt text](image.png)

**Task 1 — Draw the DFD (25 min)** · *Goal:* map the system. *Steps:* identify the external entity (web client), the process (Flask app), the data store (`notes.db` SQLite), the `uploads/` store, and the flows for `/notes`, `/upload`, `/files/<name>`; mark the Internet→app trust boundary with a dashed line. *Deliverable:* DFD image embedded in your copy of the template.

![Week 1 DFD showing the client, Flask process, stores, flows, and dashed trust boundary](week01-dfd.svg)

The dashed line represents the Internet-to-application trust boundary. Every request from the web client crosses it, so the Flask application must treat the request data as untrusted and validate it before using it.

**Task 2 — STRIDE the elements (30 min)** · *Goal:* enumerate threats per element. *Steps:* for each element fill the S/T/R/I/D/E grid. Ground it in real code: `/notes` accepts a client-supplied `owner` with no auth (Spoofing); `/upload` saves raw `f.filename` — arbitrary-file-write (Tampering) — and echoes the resolved save path back in its response (Information disclosure); `/files/<name>` reads it back but is comparatively defended (see Task 5); no logging anywhere (Repudiation). *Deliverable:* completed STRIDE table.

| Element | S - Spoofing | T - Tampering | R - Repudiation | I - Information Disclosure | D - DoS | E - Elevation of Privilege |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/notes` | User can fake the `owner` because there is no authentication | Note data could be changed without permission | No logs to show who created or changed notes | Notes may be seen by unauthorized users | Too many requests could make the app slow | Weak access control may give users more access |
| `/upload` | User identity is not checked | Raw filename can be used to write files in unsafe locations | No logs to show who uploaded files | The submitted filename is echoed, but the original code does not expose the resolved server path | Large or many uploads could fill storage | Unsafe uploaded content could become dangerous if another component later processes it with more privilege |
| `/files/<name>` | User identity is not checked | Lower risk because the route has some protection | No logs to show who accessed files | Files may be seen without permission | Too many file requests could slow the server | Lower risk because this route has some protection |

**Mitigation note:** Authenticate callers and enforce ownership checks for notes and files instead of trusting client-provided identity. Centralize safe file storage, add structured audit logs, and enforce request-size and rate limits to address tampering, repudiation, disclosure, and denial-of-service risks.

**Task 3 — Elevation of Privilege game (20 min)** · *Goal:* find threats you missed. *Steps:* play the EoP deck against your DFD; each card you can tie to a real element/flow scores a point; record every valid threat. No printer or scissors? Draw from the digital deck below instead — same 78 cards, same rule. *Deliverable:* list of carded threats + score.

```sim
eop-deck
```

## Task 3 — Elevation of Privilege Game

| Card / Threat | Related Element | Why it applies |
|---|---|---|
| S4 — “An attacker can anonymously connect…” | `/notes` | The route accepts a client-selected `owner` without authenticating the caller. |
| T6 — “An attacker can write to a data store your code relies on” | `/upload` | The original route writes an uploaded file using the client-supplied filename. |
| RK — “The system has no logs” | All routes | The app does not record who creates notes, uploads files, or downloads files. |
| I10 — “An attacker can read information in files or databases with no access controls” | `/notes`, `/files/<name>` | Both read routes are public and have no ownership check. |
| D6 — “An attacker can make a server unavailable without ever authenticating…” | `/upload` | An anonymous attacker can repeatedly upload files and consume disk and request-processing resources. |

**Score: 5 points**

**Mitigation note:** The carded threats can be reduced by authenticating every sensitive route, authorizing access to individual records and files, and routing all writes through a safe storage interface. Security-relevant logging and upload quotas would make abusive actions traceable and limit resource exhaustion.

**Task 3b — Systems-level pass (25 min) 🔭** · *Goal:* find what the per-element grid cannot see. Tasks 2 and 3 enumerate threats **one element at a time**, and that is exactly where threat models are known to stop short — students taught STRIDE alone reliably identify component threats and *discount system-level ones* ([Joshi et al., ASEE 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16632)). So do a second pass over the **whole** diagram:
![Three trust zones — public internet, application tier, data tier — with the two boundaries a request crosses between them](img/trust-boundaries.svg)

- **Trust boundaries end-to-end.** Follow one request from the client to `notes.db` and back. List every boundary it crosses. Which crossing has no check on it?
- **Assume one element is fully owned.** Pick the Flask process, then the `uploads/` store. For each: what does the attacker now *reach* — not what is it, but where does it get them?
- **Chain two "low" findings.** Find two threats you or the EoP deck rated minor that combine into something you would not accept. Write the chain as `A → B → consequence`.
- **One-line system claim.** Finish: "Even if every element-level mitigation in Task 8 is implemented, this system still fails if ___."

Use the simulation below before you start — toggle a component to attacker-controlled and watch what it reaches:

```sim
trust-boundary
```
##### 1. Trust Boundaries
Web Client → Internet/App boundary → Flask App → App/Data boundary → notes.db → Flask App → Web Client.
The Internet → Flask App crossing has no authentication check.
##### 2. Owned Elements
**Flask App owned:**  
The attacker could reach `notes.db` and `uploads/`, allowing them to access or change stored data.
**uploads/ owned:**  
The attacker could replace or delete stored files and make `/files/<name>` return attacker-controlled or unavailable content to users.
##### 3.  Threat Chain
Predictable uploaded filename → unauthenticated `/files/<name>` route → another user's uploaded file can be downloaded without permission.

##### 4. System Claim
Even if every element-level mitigation is implemented, this system still fails if the Flask App itself is fully controlled by an attacker.

**Mitigation note:** Checks must be applied at every trust boundary, including least-privilege database and filesystem permissions behind the Flask process. If the process is compromised, separate credentials, restricted container permissions, and isolated storage reduce what the attacker can reach.

*Deliverable:* the boundary list, two owned-element reachability notes, one written chain, and the system claim.

**Task 4 — Abuse cases & attacker personas (20 min)** · *Goal:* think like specific adversaries. *Steps:* define 2 personas (e.g. a curious logged-in user; an anonymous internet attacker) and write 2 abuse cases each against the sample app, tied to DFD elements. 

##### Persona 1 — Normal User

A user who tries to access things they should not.
  1. **Pretend to be another user — `/notes`**  
   The user can use another person's name because there is no login check.
  2. **View another file — `/files/<name>`**  
   The user may try to view files that do not belong to them.

##### Persona 2 — Internet Attacker
A person from the internet who tries to harm the app.
   1. **Upload an unsafe file — `/upload`**  
   The attacker may upload a file with an unsafe filename.
   2. **Make the server slow — `/upload`**  
   The attacker may upload many large files and use too much server storage.

**Mitigation note:** Authentication and per-object authorization address the impersonation and unauthorized-read abuse cases. Filename controls, size limits, storage quotas, and rate limiting reduce the unsafe-upload and resource-exhaustion cases.

*Deliverable:* 4 abuse cases.

**Task 5 — Path-traversal deep-dive (25 min)** · *Goal:* analyze the riskiest flow. *Steps:* trace `/upload` → `/files/<name>`; explain how `../` in a filename escapes `uploads/`; sketch the secure design (`secure_filename`, store outside web root, allow-list extensions). *Deliverable:* the data flow + secure-design note.

##### Data Flow

  User
    ↓
  /upload
    ↓
  Flask App
    ↓
  uploads/
    ↓
  /files/<name>
    ↓
  User

The original upload route joins `UPLOAD_DIR` with the filename supplied by the client. A filename such as `../../evil.txt` produces `uploads/../../evil.txt`; when the operating system resolves the `..` components, the destination is outside `uploads/`. The protection in `send_from_directory()` helps the download route, but it does not undo an unsafe write that already happened during upload.

##### Secure-design note

The upload handler should canonicalize the name with `secure_filename()`, reject empty or disallowed extensions, and verify that the resolved destination remains inside the upload directory. A stronger design stores the bytes outside the web root under a server-generated identifier and serves them only through an authenticated, authorized download handler; size limits and content-type checks provide additional defense.


**Task 6 — Threat-model the project target (30 min)** · *Goal:* kick off your term project. *Steps:* stop the sample-app first (`docker compose down` — both apps bind host port 8080), then run **NoteVault** (`cd ../../project/starter-app && docker compose up`), draw a quick DFD, and list the top 3 STRIDE threats you'd investigate. *Deliverable:* NoteVault DFD + top-3 threats (reuse these in your project report — `project/REPORT-TEMPLATE.md` in the repo root).

```

**Elements:** external entity = Web Client; process = Flask App; data store = `notevault.db`; second data/command store reached via `/export` = the container's OS shell. Two trust boundaries: Internet → Flask App (every route above the dashed line), and Flask App → OS shell (crossed only by `/export`).

##### Top 3 STRIDE Threats to Investigate

| # | Threat (STRIDE) | Element / Flow | Why it's top-3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Tampering → command injection (RCE)** | `/export` | `fmt` comes straight from the query string into `subprocess.run("echo exporting notes as " + fmt, shell=True, ...)`. No escaping, `shell=True`. This is the single highest-impact flow — it crosses the Flask App → OS trust boundary and can hand an attacker a shell in the container, not just app data. |
| 2 | **Spoofing → authentication bypass** | `/login` and session cookie | The login query is assembled with string formatting, so crafted input can change its SQL logic. More importantly, the JWT signing secret is hard-coded in source, so anyone who learns the code can create a valid HS256 token whose `sub` is `admin`; accepting `none` in the algorithm list is also unsafe, but a forged `alg: none` token should not be claimed as verified without a successful test. |
| 3 | **Elevation of Privilege → client-controlled role** | `/register` | `role = request.form.get("role") or (request.json or {}).get("role") or "user"` is inserted into `users.role` with no server-side check. Anyone can `POST /register` with `role=admin` and walk into `/admin`, which then leaks every user's MD5 password hash. |

*(Honorable mention, cut for "top 3": `/api/notes/<nid>` has no ownership check — any logged-in user can read any note by guessing the integer ID (IDOR / Information Disclosure), including the admin's seeded note containing `prod db password is hunter2`.)*

**Mitigation note:** Replace `shell=True` with a fixed allow-list of export formats and execute commands without a shell, parameterize every SQL query, and keep the JWT key outside source with only HS256 accepted. Registration must assign the `user` role on the server, while `/api/notes/<nid>` must verify that the authenticated user owns the requested note.

**Task 7 — Security requirements (15 min)** · *Goal:* turn threats into testable requirements. *Steps:* write 3 security requirements as acceptance criteria ("the system must … so that …"), each mapped to a threat from Task 2 or Task 6. *Deliverable:* 3 testable security requirements.

1. **(Task 2 — `/notes` spoofing)** The system must check that a user is logged in before it lets them create a note, so that nobody can create a note under someone else's name.
2. **(Task 2/5 — `/upload` tampering)** The system must remove path characters like `../` from an uploaded filename before saving it, so that a file can never be written outside the `uploads/` folder.
3. **(Task 6 — `/register` elevation of privilege)** The system must ignore any `role` value sent by the client on registration and always set new accounts to `role=user`, so that a normal user cannot become admin just by adding a field to the request.

**Task 8 — Defend / fix it: rank & mitigate (25 min) 🛡️** · *Goal:* turn threats into action you can prove. *Steps:* rank the top 5 threats by likelihood × impact; propose one concrete mitigation each (e.g., auth on `/notes`, `secure_filename()` + allowlist for `/upload`, request logging for Repudiation, size/rate limits for DoS). Then **pick one and actually implement it** in your fork.

##### Top-5 Threats — Ranked by Likelihood × Impact

| Rank | Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation idea |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/upload` saves the raw filename — attacker can write files outside `uploads/` (path traversal) | High — just change the filename, no skill needed | High — can write a file anywhere the app process can reach | Sanitize filename with `secure_filename()` + only allow a fixed list of extensions |
| 2 | `GET /notes` returns every note without authentication (information disclosure) | High — the route is public | High — all stored note content can be exposed | Require authentication and return only notes the current user is authorized to read |
| 3 | `/notes` lets anyone set `owner` with no login check (spoofing) | High — no auth exists at all | Medium — fake/forged notes under any name | Require a logged-in session and derive the owner from it |
| 4 | No logging anywhere in the app (repudiation) | High — true for every route, all the time | Medium — nobody can prove who did what, making every other threat harder to investigate | Log each security-relevant request with timestamp, identity, source IP, route, and result |
| 5 | `/upload` has no size/count limit (DoS) | Medium — needs repeated requests | Medium — can fill the disk and stop the app from working | Add a max file size and a per-IP upload rate limit |

**Implemented: #1, the `/upload` path-traversal fix.**

2. **Evidence it works** — same payload, before and after:
```
# BEFORE the fix
$ curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/upload -F "file=@evidence.txt;filename=../../evil_before.txt"
{"saved":"../../evil_before.txt"}
$ docker compose exec sample-app sh -c "cat /evil_before.txt"
before-fix payload            # <- file escaped uploads/, landed at container ROOT

# AFTER the fix
$ curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/upload -F "file=@evidence.txt;filename=../../evil_after.txt"
{"saved":"evil_after.txt"}
$ docker compose exec sample-app sh -c "test ! -e /evil_after.txt && echo outside-file-not-created"
outside-file-not-created
$ docker compose exec sample-app sh -c "cat /app/uploads/evil_after.txt"
before-fix payload            # <- confirm the sanitized file is inside uploads/
```

3. **Class fix or instance fix?** This is an **instance fix** because `secure_filename()` and the allow-list are applied only in this upload route. It stops the tested directory traversal by removing path separators before `os.path.join()` is called, but another file-writing route could repeat the same mistake. A class fix would require all file writes to use one central storage API that generates server-side identifiers, verifies containment, and never uses a user-supplied string as a path component.

> **Why this is weighted.** Fewer than half of working developers can spot a security hole in code, and being shown vulnerabilities does not by itself teach you to find or close them. Exploiting is the half that feels like progress; defending is the half that transfers to your job.

## Part 4 — Reflection
1. Map your top finding to a CWE and to OWASP A06 (Insecure Design); explain the mapping in one sentence.
   - The unsafe upload crosses a trust boundary and uses attacker-controlled data as a filesystem path, so it maps to **CWE-501 (Trust Boundary Violation)** and **OWASP A06:2025 Insecure Design** because the original design lacks a safe storage rule for untrusted filenames.
2. Name one real-world breach caused by a design flaw (not a missing patch) and what design control would have prevented it.
   - In the 2019 Capital One breach, a misconfigured web application firewall enabled access to cloud data, while regulators later identified weaknesses in cloud risk assessment and controls. Strong pre-deployment threat modeling, least-privilege permissions for the WAF role, and tested cloud security controls would have limited or prevented the data access. Sources: [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/seattle-tech-worker-arrested-data-theft-involving-large-financial-services-company) and [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2020/nr-occ-2020-101.html).
3. Of your five mitigations, which gives the most risk reduction per unit of effort, and why?
   - Sanitizing and validating upload names gives the best immediate risk reduction for a small code change because it blocks the highest-ranked arbitrary-file-write path. It does not solve every upload risk, so the longer-term design should centralize file storage, generate server-side identifiers, and enforce size and authorization checks.

**Assessed within the rows above** (they are not extra points — they are what those points are for):
- **Systems-level reasoning** (inside *Exploitation + evidence*, Task 3b): does the model reach past single elements to boundaries, reachability and chains? Scored with the STRIDE + systems-thinking rubrics of [Joshi et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16632).
- **Defensive proof** (inside *Defense*, Task 8): a claimed mitigation with no before/after evidence scores at most half. A mitigation you can show closing a *class* scores full.
- **Adversarial thinking** (across the whole sheet): do the abuse cases, personas and chains show you reasoning as an attacker with goals and constraints — or just listing categories? This is the course's central disposition and it is assessed, not assumed.

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show a terminal running `printf '%s | %s | ' "$(whoami)" '<YOUR-STUDENT-ID>'; date '+%F %T %Z'` **in the
  same image as the evidence**. When the evidence is a browser page, a DevTools panel or a
  rendered response, put that terminal **beside the browser and capture the whole screen** — a
  cropped window carries nothing that identifies you, and the lab's own output is
  byte-identical for the whole cohort *by design*, so the stamp is the only thing that makes
  the shot yours. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag:** **N/A — this week has no arena challenge, so no flag is issued.** Leave this blank.
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?

## 🤖 Audit the AI (required)

AI is a power tool you must **distrust** — you are graded on your *critique*, not the AI's answer.

1. Ask an AI assistant to exploit **or** fix this week's vulnerability. Paste its full answer.
2. **Find what's wrong or risky** in it — insecure code, a subtly incomplete fix, a hallucinated API/function/CVE, a missed edge case, or wrong reasoning. Quote the exact line(s).
3. Produce the **correct, verified** version yourself and explain in 2–3 sentences why the AI's output was insufficient.

> Disclose your AI use in the Part 1 table. This task counts toward your **Defense + Reflection** score.

### AI answer received

> Use `secure_filename()` before saving the upload:
> ```python
> filename = secure_filename(f.filename)
> f.save(os.path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, filename))
> ```
> This completely fixes file-upload security because attackers can no longer use `../` in a filename.

### My audit

The risky line is: **“This completely fixes file-upload security.”** The code addresses filename-based traversal at this call site, but it does not reject an empty sanitized name, restrict extensions, limit upload size, verify file content, prevent overwriting an existing file, or protect another route that writes files. Therefore, it is an incomplete instance fix rather than a complete solution to the whole upload-security class.

### Corrected and verified version

I added `secure_filename()`, rejected empty names, and applied an extension allow-list in `sample-app/app.py`. The traversal input `../../evil_after.txt` is stored as `evil_after.txt` inside `uploads/` and does not create `/evil_after.txt`, showing that the tested escape no longer works; a centralized storage service with server-generated identifiers would be the stronger class fix.

## 🧠 Comprehension & Prompt (required)

**A. Explain in Plain English (EiPE).** In 2–3 sentences, in your own words, describe what this week's vulnerable code/endpoint actually *does* and *why it is exploitable* — explain the mechanism, don't dump jargon.

The upload endpoint receives a file and originally used the name supplied by the client when choosing where to save it. Because names containing `../` tell the operating system to move to parent directories, an attacker could make the application write outside its intended `uploads/` folder.

**B. Prompt Problem.** Write a **single prompt** that makes an AI produce a *correct, secure* fix for one finding. Run it: does the exploit now fail? If not, refine the prompt and try again. Submit the **final prompt + the verified result**.
*Graded on the prompt's precision and your verification — this trains problem decomposition and AI literacy (Denny et al. 2024).*

**Final prompt:**

> Review this Flask `/upload` endpoint for filename-based path traversal. Modify it to sanitize the original filename with Werkzeug's `secure_filename()`, reject an empty result, permit only `txt`, `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, and `pdf` extensions, and save only the sanitized name under `UPLOAD_DIR`. Preserve the JSON response format, explain whether this is an instance or class fix, and provide a Flask test-client test using the submitted filename `../../evil_after.txt` that proves no file is created outside `UPLOAD_DIR`.

**Verified result:** The request returned `{"saved":"evil_after.txt"}` and `/evil_after.txt` did not exist. Before submission, the evidence screenshot must also show `uploads/evil_after.txt` so the result proves both where the file was not written and where it was written.

---

## Personal evidence still required before submission

The written analysis cannot replace personal evidence. Retake every submitted screenshot with a terminal visible in the same image after running:

```bash
printf '%s | %s | ' "$(whoami)" '6631503129'; date '+%F %T %Z'
```

Capture at least: the running sample app and JSON response, the corrected DFD, the completed STRIDE/EoP tables, the NoteVault DFD/top-three table, and the before/after Task 8 commands. For the after result, also show `docker compose exec sample-app sh -c "cat /app/uploads/evil_after.txt"` and `docker compose exec sample-app sh -c "test ! -e /evil_after.txt && echo outside-file-not-created"`.
