// This is the SAME logic as parse_input()/vulnerable() in vuln.c — read a line
// of user input and report its length — but written in safe Rust. The CWE-121
// stack-buffer-overflow and CWE-134 format-string bug classes are *impossible*
// here, and we explain why inline.
//
// Build + run:
//   rustc safe.rs && ./safe
//   echo "AAAA...(any length)..." | ./safe     # never overflows, never crashes

use std::io::{self, Read};

/// Equivalent of parse_input() — but there is NO fixed-size raw buffer and NO
/// unchecked copy.
///
/// Why the overflow (CWE-121 / CWE-787) cannot happen:
///   * `String` is heap-backed and GROWS automatically; we never copy into a
///     fixed 64-byte stack array, so there is nothing to overflow.
///   * Even if we *did* use a fixed array, Rust inserts bounds checks on every
///     index/slice access and panics safely instead of corrupting the stack.
///   * There is no `strcpy`: ownership + the borrow checker forbid the kind of
///     unbounded raw-pointer copy that makes the C version exploitable.
fn parse_input(src: &str) -> usize {

    // Read ALL of stdin into a growable String. No size cap to overflow.

    // Why the format-string bug (CWE-134) cannot happen:
    //   Rust's `println!`/`print!` format string MUST be a compile-time string
    //   literal; user data can only go into `{}` arguments, never become the
    //   format itself. `println!(line)` with a runtime String simply does not
    //   compile. So "%n"/"%x" in the input are printed literally, harmlessly.
    println!("Hello, your input was {} characters long.", n);
