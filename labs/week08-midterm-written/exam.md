# Midterm — Written Exam (Week 8)

**Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · **Covers:** Weeks 1–6
**Time:** 120 min · **Total:** 100 pts · Closed book unless stated otherwise.

**Name:** ____________________  **Student ID:** ____________  **Date:** ________

> Answer in your own words. For code answers, write the exact payload/fix. Sandbox/ethics rules apply to all scenarios.

## Section A — Concepts (30 pts, 5 each)

A1. Define the **CIA triad** and give one realistic threat against each property.

A2. Map each **STRIDE** letter to the security property it violates.

A3. Compare **SAST vs DAST vs SCA vs fuzzing** — what each sees and when it runs.

A4. Explain **hashing vs encryption vs encoding**, with one correct use of each.

A5. What is a **trust boundary**? Identify two in a typical web app + database.

A6. Define **least privilege** and **fail closed**, with one example each.

## Section B — Spot the Vulnerability (20 pts, 5 each)
*Name the vulnerability (+ CWE) and give the fix.*

B1.
```python
q = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='" + request.args["name"] + "'"
db.execute(q)
```

B2.
```python
return f"<h1>Hello {request.args['name']}</h1>"   # rendered in the browser
```

B3.
```python
data = jwt.decode(tok, options={"verify_signature": False})
if data["role"] == "admin": grant()
```

B4.
```python
import hashlib
def store(pw): return hashlib.md5(pw.encode()).hexdigest()
```

## Section C — Applied SQL Injection (30 pts)

A login runs this query (both fields are required, cannot be blank):
```sql
SELECT uid, name, salary, password FROM usertable
WHERE profileID = 10 AND password = '<hash>'
```

C1. (6) `profileID` is an **integer** parameter. What do you put in **profileID** and **password** to log in without the password? Explain why it works.

C2. (6) Now `profileID` is a **string** (`WHERE profileID='10' AND password='...'`). Give the injection and explain the difference from C1.

C3. (6) The form is submitted via **GET**: `/login?profileID=a&password=a`. Write the edited GET request to bypass auth, and explain the comment handling.

C4. (6) You can inject into an `UPDATE` on an edit-profile page. Write **three different** injections to fingerprint whether the DB is **MySQL/MSSQL, Oracle, or SQLite** (version).

C5. (6) Write a subquery to dump **all table names** from a SQLite DB into one field. (Hint: `group_concat` + `sqlite_master`.)

---

## Section D — Defense & Design (20 pts, 10 each)

D1. List **three** distinct defenses against SQL injection and explain why client-side validation is **not** one of them.

D2. You must add a "reset password" feature. Describe a secure design: token generation, storage, expiry, and how you avoid IDOR and account enumeration.

*End of exam. Pair with the Week 9 hands-on CTF practical.*
