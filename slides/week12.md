# Week 12
## Software Supply-Chain Security
Software Security · Nutthakorn Chalaemwongwan

<!-- Hook: ask how many lines of code they wrote in their last project vs how many they shipped. The gap is dependencies — and that's the attack surface this week. One poisoned package = thousands of victims. ~2 min. -->

---

## Today

- Why the supply chain is now top-tier
- Dependency confusion & typosquatting
- SBOMs, SLSA provenance
- Signing with Sigstore/Cosign
- 🎮 Game: **Dependency Confusion Heist**

<!-- Roadmap, 1 min. Three verbs to remember all week: KNOW your ingredients (SBOM), PROVE your build (SLSA), SIGN your artifacts (Cosign). -->

---

## The new #1 design risk

- Your code is ~10% yours, ~90% dependencies
- One bad package → thousands of victims (xz, event-stream, SolarWinds)
- **OWASP A03:2025 Software Supply Chain Failures**

<!-- New in OWASP 2025 — promoted to A03, reflecting reality. The 10/90 ratio shocks students. You can write perfect code and still be owned through a dependency you never read. ~4 min. -->

---

## Most of your attack surface is other people's code

![Why the supply chain is now the top-tier risk: you write about 10% of what you ship and dependencies are the other ~90%, so every bug in that 90% ships under your name; one poisoned package fans out to thousands of downstream victims (xz-utils 2024, event-stream 2018, SolarWinds 2020); and OWASP promoted this up the list to A03:2025 Software Supply Chain Failures. You can write perfect code and still be owned through a dependency you never read.](img/supply-chain-design-risk.svg)

<!-- The 10/90 ratio made visual — land it hard, then the blast radius (one publish → thousands), then the A03:2025 promotion. The closing line is the week's thesis. ~2 min. -->

---

## Real supply-chain attacks

| Case | What happened |
|---|---|
| **SolarWinds** (2020) | trojanized vendor update → 18k orgs |
| **Log4Shell** (2021) | RCE in a ubiquitous logging dep |
| **event-stream** (npm) | malicious dep stole crypto-wallet keys |
| **XZ Utils** (2024) | backdoor planted in `liblzma` upstream |
| **CircleCI** (2023) | stolen CI tokens → customer secrets |

> Attacks are shifting **upstream**: registry → maintainer → CI/CD.

<!-- Spend time on xz (2024): a patient attacker became a trusted maintainer over years, then planted a backdoor caught only by luck (a 0.5s SSH delay). The lesson: trust in maintainers is itself attackable. ~5 min. -->

---

## Attack vectors

- **Typosquatting** — `reqeusts` vs `requests`; the malicious package's `setup.py` runs **at install time**, before any of your code runs — you don't have to import it to be owned
- **Dependency confusion** (**CWE-1357**) — public pkg shadows internal name
- **Malicious updates** — compromised maintainer
- **Transitive risk** — deps of deps you never chose

<!-- Define dependency confusion clearly (it's the game): if your internal pkg "acme-utils" isn't scoped, a public "acme-utils" with a higher version number can get pulled instead. Transitive = you vet your 10 deps, but they pull 800 you never saw. Stress the install-time-execution point — it's why "I never imported it" isn't a defense, and it's exactly what the lab's PWNED.txt marker proves. ~5 min. -->

---

## Four ways a dependency turns malicious

![The four supply-chain attack vectors as a taxonomy: typosquatting (a malicious package named like one you use — reqeusts for requests — whose setup.py runs at install time, before any import, so a single typo is enough to be owned); dependency confusion (CWE-1357, a public package with a higher version shadows your internal name and is pulled instead); malicious updates (a hijacked or compromised maintainer ships a bad version of a package you already trust); and transitive risk (the dependencies of your dependencies, code you never chose or reviewed but still ship). The trust boundary is bigger than your requirements.txt.](img/supply-chain-attack-vectors.svg)

<!-- The four vectors as cards — the one to hammer is install-time execution (typosquat setup.py), because it kills the "I never imported it" defense and is exactly what the lab's PWNED.txt proves. Dependency confusion is the game. ~2 min. -->

---

## Try it — which package actually installs?

Set both versions and the index mode. The resolver's real rule decides.

```sim
resolver-confusion
```

<!-- Let them find the uncomfortable case themselves: merged mode with the private version numerically HIGHER also happens to be "safe" — but say explicitly that this is not a defense, just luck, since the attacker picks their own version number and will publish something higher. The only real fix in this sim is switching to single-index mode. Ties directly to Task 2 and Task 4's defense #2. ~4 min. -->

---

## SCA — find vulnerable deps

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" aquasec/trivy fs /src   # this lab's Python deps
pip-audit                                                          # vs PyPI advisories
```

- Produces CVEs + fix versions
- CWE-1104 (unmaintained), CWE-829 (untrusted inclusion), **CWE-1395** (known-vulnerable 3rd-party dependency)

![Software Composition Analysis turns requirements.txt into a remediation worklist: the pinned-but-outdated deps (Flask 1.1.4, Jinja2 2.11.3, urllib3 1.26.4) feed two scanners — trivy fs (matches versions to the CVE database) and pip-audit (checks PyPI advisories) — neither of which reads your code, both read your dependency list. The output is one row per vulnerable package with the version that fixes it: Flask → 2.3.2 (CVE-2023-30861, HIGH), Jinja2 → 2.11.4 (CVE-2020-28493 ReDoS), urllib3 → 1.26.17 (CVE-2023-43804, HIGH). The contrast: SAST reads the code you wrote and finds your bugs; SCA reads the versions you depend on and finds other people's known, already-patched bugs, so the fix is a version bump, not a code change.](img/sca-worklist.svg)

<!-- Hands-on tooling (ties to W2 SCA). This lab is pure Python — no npm project — so it's trivy fs + pip-audit, not npm audit/dependency-check. Run trivy live on the project — it lists CVEs + the fixed version. The diagram's one job: SCA ≠ SAST. SAST = your code, your bugs; SCA = your versions, other people's known bugs, fix = bump the pin. Don't read the worklist rows aloud — they'll run it live; point at the "→ FIXED IN" column and say "that's the whole remediation, a version number." Q6 of the quiz asks for one real vulnerable dependency they found + remediation. ~4 min. -->

---

## Integrity: prove what you shipped

- **SBOM** (CycloneDX/SPDX) — ingredient list of the build
- **SLSA** — levels of build provenance & tamper-resistance
- **A08:2025** Software/Data Integrity Failures

<!-- SBOM = the food-label analogy: you can't manage what you can't list. When the next Log4Shell drops, an SBOM answers "are we affected?" in seconds. SLSA Build Track = levels L0–L3 of build provenance / tamper-resistance (L3 is the top; the old "1–4" numbering was v0.1 and is deprecated). ~5 min. -->

---

## Know what's in it, prove how it was built

![Two integrity controls side by side. Left, an SBOM (CycloneDX / SPDX): the build's itemized ingredient list — every component and version — so when the next Log4Shell drops you search it and answer "are we affected?" in seconds, not weeks. Right, SLSA: a ladder of build-provenance levels from L0 to L3 — L0 no guarantees, L1 provenance exists but is forgeable, L2 hosted build and signed (tamper-evident), L3 hardened builds whose provenance cannot be forged. SBOM knows what is in it; SLSA proves how it was built. Both map to OWASP A08:2025 Software or Data Integrity Failures.](img/sbom-slsa-integrity.svg)

<!-- SBOM = food label (know the ingredients, fast incident response); SLSA = the provenance ladder L0-L3 (prove how it was built). Two different questions, both integrity. Note the L0-L3 numbering replaces the deprecated 1-4. ~2 min. -->

---

## Signing with Cosign (keyless)

```bash
IMG=week12-supplychain:lab
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  aquasec/trivy:latest image --format cyclonedx \
  --output /src/sbom.cdx.json "$IMG"                          # SBOM
docker run --rm -e COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign:latest sign --yes "$IMG"       # sign (OIDC)
docker run --rm -e COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign:latest verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp ".*" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer-regexp ".*" "$IMG"                 # verify
```

- Unsigned/tampered image → verification fails
- **Every step needs the docker-socket mount** (trivy has to reach the local image, not just a local dir) — the SBOM step is a common copy-paste failure if it's dropped
- **`cosign verify` needs the two `--certificate-*-regexp` flags** in keyless mode — without them it errors, it doesn't just "fail closed"
- Keyless signing is backed by **Fulcio** (short-lived cert authority) + **Rekor** (public transparency log) — no long-lived private key sitting on disk to leak (**CWE-321**)

<!-- Demo the sign→verify loop. sign.sh runs both tools dockerized — match that here, not a bare local binary. Keyless (Sigstore) = identity-based signing via OIDC through Fulcio, logged in Rekor, no key to leak — name both by name, worksheet Q4 grades on the vocabulary. The deploy gate: refuse any image that doesn't verify → a tampered artifact can't ship. This is the lab's defend step. ~4 min. -->

---

## Keyless signing — the flow

![How Sigstore keyless signing works with no long-lived private key: cosign sign authenticates via an OIDC identity (GitHub/Google), Fulcio issues a short-lived (~10 min) certificate bound to that identity, cosign signs with an ephemeral key then discards it, and the signature + certificate are recorded in Rekor's public transparency log — so nothing long-lived is ever written to disk and there is no private key to leak (avoiding CWE-321). At deploy, cosign verify checks the signature against the expected identity and the Rekor log: a valid, matching signature is allowed to deploy; an unsigned or tampered image returns "no signatures found" and the gate blocks it.](img/sigstore-keyless.svg)

<!-- The mental model behind the bash on the previous slide — walk it once, left to right across the sign lane, then down to the verify gate. The one idea that lands: there is no key to protect because there is no long-lived key at all; trust is anchored to an OIDC identity and a public log, not a secret file. Fulcio = the short-lived-cert CA, Rekor = the transparency log — worksheet Q4 grades on naming both. Don't re-read every box; students have the diagram, spend the time on the "identity, not a key" punchline. ~3 min. -->

---

## Verify the signature — does it deploy?

Signed, unsigned, tampered, or signed by someone else. Run the gate and watch.

```sim
cosign-verify
```

<!-- The interactive companion to the keyless-signing diagram: it runs cosign's VERIFY logic in the page, so students drive the deploy gate themselves. Walk the four image states: unsigned → "no signatures found"; tampered → the signature no longer matches the digest; our CI → deploys; signed by another identity → blocked ONLY if the policy pins the expected signer. The move that lands the lesson: flip "pin the expected signer" OFF (the lab command's own '.*') and the attacker's validly-signed image deploys — a valid signature is not a signature you should trust. That's why the two --certificate-*-regexp flags from the previous slide must name YOUR identity, not '.*'. Ties to Task 3's verify-before-deploy gate and worksheet Q4. ~3 min. -->

---

## Tooling — GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)

- **Secret scanning** + **push protection** — block secrets at push time (before they reach the remote)
- **CodeQL** code scanning — semantic SAST queries
- **Dependabot** — alerts + auto-PRs for vulnerable deps
- Native in the repo → results in the Security tab

<!-- The managed option students will meet in industry. Dependabot is the practical supply-chain workhorse: it opens PRs bumping vulnerable deps automatically. Push protection stops secrets at push time — local commits with a secret are allowed, the block fires on push to the remote (recall W2). ~3 min. -->

---

## Defenses

- **`pip install --require-hashes`** — a substituted package's hash won't match; install refuses
- **Single `--index-url`, not `--extra-index-url`** — one trusted index; the resolver won't "shop around" and pick a higher-versioned public package over your internal one
- Verify signatures before deploy (admission policy)
- Generate + store SBOMs per release
- 2FA/MFA on dev/CI/cloud accounts; least privilege
- Automate SCA in CI (next week)

<!-- The payoff checklist, now with the exact flags Task 4 grades. --require-hashes and single-index-url are what actually stops dependency confusion — "pin + scope" alone is too vague to reconstruct on the exam. Verify-before-deploy kills tampered artifacts; MFA on maintainer/CI accounts kills the xz/CircleCI vector. "Automate in CI" sets up W15. ~4 min. -->

---

## The whole journey, one dependency

![Six hops a dependency crosses from a public registry into production, each with its own attack and the control that answers it: registry (typosquatting → one trusted index), resolver (dependency confusion → scope the namespace), fetch (compromised maintainer → lockfile with hashes), build (stale pins → SCA in CI), image (no inventory → SBOM), deploy (unsigned image → Sigstore keyless gate). "We scanned our code" covers none of this — SAST reads the code you wrote, all six hops are code you didn't.](img/supply-chain.svg)

<!-- The synthesis slide — everything from the last five slides (SAST/SCA, SBOM, Cosign, the defenses checklist) is one column each in this diagram, chained in the order a real dependency actually travels. Walk it left to right ONE time, don't re-teach each hop — the point is showing they were never separate tools, they're six links in the same chain. Land on the closing line before moving to the game. ~5 min. -->

---

## 📦 Game — Dependency Confusion Heist

1. **Attack:** no live registry in this lab — use the resolver simulation to watch a higher-version public pkg beat the private one
2. **Defend:** pin + scope; generate SBOM; sign & verify with Cosign; add a provenance gate

<!-- Explain before lab — the resolver simulation stands in for a live registry (ethics: never publish a real typosquat). Defend side is graded. The SLSA self-assessment makes them reason about their own pipeline. ~3 min. -->

---

## Deliverable

> 📋 **Worksheet 12** — `labs/week12-supply-chain/worksheet.md` (Parts 1–4) · **kickoff:** `bash sca_scan.sh` (trivy fs + pip-audit)

- SCA report + remediation plan (Part 3)
- SBOM file + sign/verify transcript (Part 3)
- One-paragraph SLSA self-assessment + XZ Utils case analysis (Part 4)
- **+ Audit the AI / EiPE / Prompt Problem** (required, after Part 4 — see worksheet)

<!-- The SLSA self-assessment is the thinking part — they place their own build on the ladder and justify it. AI-resilient tasks count. -->

---

## Key takeaways

- Most of your attack surface is other people's code
- Know your ingredients (SBOM), prove your build (SLSA), sign your artifacts
- Verify before you trust

<!-- Recap with the three verbs. Cold-call: "the next Log4Shell drops at 2am — what artifact tells you if you're affected?" (the SBOM). ~2 min. -->
