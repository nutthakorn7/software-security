# Week 3
## Cryptography Used Correctly (and Misused)
Software Security · Nutthakorn Chalaemwongwan

<!-- Hook: paste an MD5 hash on screen and crack it live in seconds with a wordlist — "this is why how you store passwords matters." Today is about using crypto correctly; most failures are misuse, not broken math. ~2 min. -->

---

## Today

- Hashing vs encryption vs encoding
- Password storage done right
- Symmetric / asymmetric basics
- Common crypto failures (A04:2025)
- 🔓 Game: **Capture the Hash**

<!-- Roadmap, 1 min. Lab: crack weak hashes + break an ECB oracle, then remediate. Theme: "don't roll your own crypto; misuse vetted primitives correctly." -->

---

## Recap — Week 2

- Tools find bug *patterns*; today we study one bug *class* deeply
- Crypto misuse is subtle: code "works" but isn't safe

<!-- Bridge: a SAST tool flags MD5 (W2) — today we understand WHY it's wrong and what to do instead. ~1 min. -->

---

## Three things people confuse

- **Hashing** — one-way, fixed-size digest (integrity, passwords)
- **Encryption** — reversible *with a key* (confidentiality)
- **Encoding** — reversible *without a key* (Base64 ≠ security!)

<!-- The #1 source of crypto bugs is conceptual confusion. Demo: base64-decode a string live to show encoding gives no protection. Ask: "is hashing reversible?" (no) "is Base64?" (yes, trivially). ~5 min. -->

---

## Symmetric vs asymmetric

- **Symmetric** (AES, ChaCha20) — one shared key, fast
- **Asymmetric** (RSA, ECC) — public/private key pair
- TLS uses asymmetric to exchange a symmetric session key

<!-- Keep it intuitive: symmetric = one shared password (fast, but key distribution problem); asymmetric = padlock anyone can close, only you open. TLS = best of both. ~4 min. -->

---

## Password storage

- Never store plaintext or plain hashes
- Use a **slow, salted KDF**, in order of preference: **argon2id** → scrypt (if argon2id unavailable) → bcrypt (legacy systems only) → PBKDF2 (FIPS-140 compliance only)
- Salt is per-user and random

```python
from argon2 import PasswordHasher
ph = PasswordHasher(); hash = ph.hash("correct horse battery staple")
```

<!-- The single most common real-world crypto failure. Why slow + salted: slow defeats brute force, salt defeats rainbow tables and makes identical passwords hash differently. Tie to the hook (cracked MD5). ~6 min. -->

---

## Worked example: why ECB leaks

- ECB encrypts each block independently → **patterns survive**
- The classic "ECB penguin": the image is still recognizable encrypted
- **CBC isn't the fix either** — no integrity check means an attacker can flip bits in the ciphertext and the corresponding plaintext bits flip predictably
- Fix: an **authenticated** mode (**AES-GCM**) with a random nonce — confidentiality *and* integrity together

```sim
aes-modes
```

<!-- The visual that makes ECB "click" — an ECB-penguin-style panel AND a live CBC-malleability demo (flip a ciphertext bit, watch the plaintext bit flip in a sess=...;admin=0;... token) in one sim. Don't stop at "ECB bad, GCM good" — CBC's lack of integrity is the middle step that makes AEAD's *value* click. This is exactly the ECB oracle they break in the lab. ~6 min. -->

---

## ECB in one picture

![Two identical 16-byte plaintext blocks encrypted with ECB become two identical ciphertext blocks, so the repetition leaks (the ECB-penguin effect); the same input re-encrypts to the same bytes because there is no nonce. AES-GCM with a random nonce and auth tag produces different, random-looking blocks and detects tampering. Choosing AES is not the fix — AES-ECB leaks and AES-GCM under a hardcoded key is still CWE-798.](img/ecb-pattern-leak.svg)

<!-- Leave this up during Capture the Hash. The static companion to the aes-modes sim: identical plaintext -> identical ciphertext (orange, '='), and GCM -> different blocks (blue, '='-crossed). Point at the two equal orange blocks: 'that equality is the leak.' Land on the footer: AES is a primitive, not a decision — mode, nonce, key source and RNG are four separate choices. ~3 min. -->

---

## Capture the Hash — how cracking works

```bash
# strip comments, then crack unsalted MD5 with a wordlist
hashcat -m 0 hashes.txt rockyou.txt
```

- Unsalted fast hash → attacker hashes wordlist once, matches millions
- Salt would force per-guess work; a slow KDF makes it infeasible

<!-- Walk the attack: the attacker doesn't "reverse" the hash — they hash guesses and compare. Fast+unsalted = cheap; salted+slow = expensive. This is the lab's round 1. ~5 min. -->

---

## Common crypto failures (A04:2025)

- **ECB mode** → block patterns leak
- Hardcoded keys / keys in source (CWE-321, a case of CWE-798)
- Weak RNG (`random` instead of `secrets`/CSPRNG) (CWE-330)
- **MD5 / SHA-1** for security; unauthenticated encryption (no integrity)

<!-- The checklist of what to look for / avoid. Each maps to a CWE they'll cite. Note: "no integrity" = attacker can flip ciphertext bits undetected → that's why AEAD (GCM) matters. ~4 min. -->

---

## Do this instead

- Authenticated encryption: **AES-GCM** or **ChaCha20-Poly1305**
- Keys from a secrets manager / KMS — never in code
- CSPRNG: `secrets` (Python), `crypto.randomBytes` (Node)
- SHA-256+ for integrity; argon2id/bcrypt for passwords

<!-- The "right answers" slide — students should leave able to pick the correct primitive. Emphasize: use vetted libraries, don't invent. ~3 min. -->

---

## CWE mapping

- **CWE-327** — broken/risky crypto algorithm
- **CWE-916** — weak password hash (no/weak KDF)
- **CWE-330** — insufficiently random values
- **CWE-321** — hardcoded key (a case of CWE-798, which OWASP files under A07)

<!-- Quick reference; they map lab findings to these. ~1 min. -->

---

## Four fixes — in the code

```python
# vulnerable_crypto.py                       ->  solution_skeleton.py
md5(pw).hexdigest()           # CWE-916      ->  argon2.PasswordHasher().hash(pw)
AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)    # CWE-327      ->  AES.new(key, MODE_GCM, nonce=os.urandom(12))
HARDCODED_KEY = b"0123..."    # CWE-798      ->  bytes.fromhex(os.environ["ENC_KEY_HEX"])
random.choice("0123456789")   # CWE-330      ->  secrets.token_urlsafe(16)
```

- Four separate decisions — **KDF · cipher mode · key source · RNG** — not one "use better crypto"
- "Use AES" answers none of them: AES-ECB leaks; AES-GCM under a hardcoded key is still CWE-798
- Each fix makes the value **unguessable / authenticated / unique**, not merely "encrypted"

<!-- The mechanism slide, parallel to Wk4 parameterize / Wk5 encode. Walk the four rows: md5 is fast + unsalted so a GPU cracks it -> argon2id is slow + salted; ECB leaks -> GCM adds nonce (unique) + tag (integrity); a hardcoded key means one leak breaks everything -> load it from the environment/KMS; random is predictable -> secrets is a CSPRNG. Punch line: crypto isn't one switch, it's four decisions, and a strong primitive with a weak decision is still broken. ~5 min. -->

---

## Four decisions, four fixes

![Four crypto misuses and their fixes: password storage (md5 to argon2id), cipher mode (hardcoded-key ECB to GCM with a nonce and auth tag), randomness (random.choice to secrets.token_urlsafe), and key source (hardcoded key to an environment variable). One cipher name answers none of these four questions — AES-GCM under a hardcoded key is still CWE-798.](img/crypto-misuse.svg)

<!-- Synthesis slide — the four separate concepts from the last several slides (KDF, cipher mode, RNG, key source) are one decision each in vulnerable_crypto.py, not one big "use better crypto" fix. Land on the closing line: picking AES-GCM doesn't save you if the key is still hardcoded. ~4 min. -->

---

## 🔓 Game — Capture the Hash

- **Round 1 (speedrun):** crack unsalted/MD5 hashes — fastest team wins
- **Round 2:** exploit an **ECB oracle** (identical blocks)
- **Round 3 (defend):** run the fixed version (argon2id + AES-GCM + keys from env) and confirm it holds — **then author two pieces yourself**: migrate a legacy MD5 record to argon2id on next login, and write the decrypt+tamper-check the fixed version doesn't include for you

<!-- Explain rounds before lab. Round 1 = instant-feedback fun. Round 3 is NOT just "run the pre-fixed code and verify" — be precise that the rehash-on-login migration and the GCM decrypt/tamper-check are the parts students actually write; the rest of the fixed script is handed to them already implemented. Leaderboard on round 1. ~3 min. -->

---

## Lab 3 — deliverable

> 📋 **Worksheet 3** — `labs/week03-cryptography/worksheet.md` (Part 3) · **kickoff:** `docker compose up` (runs the crypto scripts)

- Cracked hashes + method · ECB-leak proof · predictable-token note
- **Before/after** code (misuse → fix → CWE closed) — incl. your rehash-on-login migration + GCM decrypt/tamper-check
- TLS: read a real cert's issuer/subject/validity + negotiated protocol version
- Crack **NoteVault's** own MD5 hashes for the term-project report
- Every screenshot needs your **whoami + student ID + timestamp in-frame** — this lab's raw output is identical for the whole cohort by design, so unstamped evidence isn't gradable
- **+ Audit the AI / EiPE / Prompt Problem** (see worksheet)

<!-- Graded output — six pieces, not three; don't let the deliverable slide undersell TLS (Task 8) or the evidence stamp (highest-impact single miss if skipped — output is byte-identical across the cohort without it). Point to vulnerable_crypto.py + solution_skeleton.py. -->

## Key takeaways

- Encoding ≠ encryption; hashing isn't reversible
- Use vetted KDFs + authenticated encryption — never roll your own
- Randomness & key handling matter as much as the algorithm

<!-- Recap. Cold-call: "how should we store passwords, and why salted+slow?" ~2 min. -->
