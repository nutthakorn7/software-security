# Week 2
## Secure SDLC, Tooling & Fuzzing
Software Security · Nutthakorn Chalaemwongwan

<!-- Hook: open by running a scanner live on a flawed repo and let a finding pop up in seconds — "this is how the industry finds bugs at scale." Today = the tools + the mindset of catching bugs early. ~2 min. -->

---

## Today

- Security across the SDLC ("shift left")
- SAST · DAST · SCA · secret scanning · **fuzzing**
- Triaging findings by CWE
- 🏁 Game: **Bug Triage Race** + a **Fuzzing Race**

<!-- Roadmap, 1 min. Flag the lab: scan a deliberately flawed repo, triage by CWE, then fix. Bonus: first team to crash a target with a fuzzer. -->

---

## Recap — Week 1

- Threat modeling finds *design* flaws (before code)
- This week: find *implementation* flaws — automatically, at scale
- Same goal: catch it early, cheap to fix

<!-- Bridge from W1. W1 = think (design). W2 = automate (code). Remind the cost curve: a bug caught in CI costs ~1×, in production ~100×. ~2 min. -->

---

## Security across the SDLC

Requirements → Design → Code → Build → Test → Deploy → Operate

- Each phase has security activities
- **Shift left:** find issues early — cheaper to fix
- DevSecOps = security automated into the pipeline

<!-- Walk the phases on the board; ask "where can security live?" (answer: every phase). Threat modeling = design; SAST/secret scan = code/commit; DAST = test; monitoring = operate. "Shift left" = move detection earlier. ~5 min. -->

---

## The tooling families

| Tool | What it sees | When |
|---|---|---|
| **SAST** | source code | code/commit |
| **DAST** | running app | test/staging |
| **SCA** | dependencies | build |
| **Secret scanning** | secrets in code/history | commit/CI |
| **Fuzzing** | runtime + random inputs | test |

<!-- The mental map for the whole unit. Stress: no single tool finds everything — they see different things. Tie each to a later week (SCA → W12, DAST → Burp in W4-6). ~5 min. -->

---

## SAST vs DAST in one line

- **SAST** — reads the code, finds bug patterns (no running). Many false positives.
- **DAST** — attacks the live app from outside. Fewer FPs, misses source-level issues.

> Use both — they find different things.

<!-- The classic comparison students confuse. Analogy: SAST = proofreading the recipe; DAST = tasting the cooked dish. SAST sees a hardcoded secret DAST never will; DAST sees an auth bypass SAST can't. ~4 min. -->

---

## Worked example: what each tool catches

```python
@app.route("/user")
def user():
    name = request.args.get("name")
    q = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='%s'" % name   # SAST → CWE-89
    return db.execute(q).fetchall()
AWS_SECRET = "wJalr...EXAMPLEKEY"                       # Gitleaks → CWE-798
```

- **Semgrep (SAST):** flags the string-built SQL query (CWE-89)
- **Gitleaks (secret scan):** flags the hardcoded AWS key (CWE-798)
- **DAST/fuzzer:** would catch a crash/SQLi by *hitting* `/user`, not reading it

<!-- The make-it-concrete slide — point at the exact lines each tool fires on. This is the `vulnerable-repo/app.py` they'll scan in the lab. Ask: "which tool finds the secret? which finds the SQLi? could one tool find both?" ~6 min. -->

---

## Fuzzing — how real CVEs are found

- Feed **random/mutated inputs**, watch for crashes
- **Coverage-guided** (libFuzzer/AFL++) explores new code paths
- Pair with sanitizers (ASan) to pinpoint the bug

```bash
clang -fsanitize=address,fuzzer harness.c -o fuzz && ./fuzz
```

<!-- Fuzzing is the highest-yield bug finder in industry (most memory CVEs come from it). Explain coverage-guided = the fuzzer "learns" inputs that reach new code. Deep dive + exploit comes in W11. ~5 min. -->

---

## Triage: not every finding is a bug

- **True positive** vs **false positive**
- Map each to a **CWE** + severity
- Prioritize by exploitability × impact
- Noise kills trust in tools — triage well

<!-- Crucial professional skill: a scanner that cries wolf gets ignored. Show a likely false positive vs a real one. Teach: every finding gets a CWE + a TP/FP call + a one-line justification. ~4 min. -->

---

## Tools you'll meet

- **SonarQube** — code quality + SAST against the "7 axes" (bugs, duplication, complexity, coverage…)
- **GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)** — CodeQL + secret scanning + Dependabot, native in the repo
- Address **technical debt** early — cheaper than re-work later

<!-- Name the real tools they'll see in industry/internships. SonarQube = quality gate; GHAS = security native in GitHub. Connect "technical debt" to the cost curve from the recap. ~3 min. -->

---

## 🏁 Game — Bug Triage Race

- Run **Semgrep + Gitleaks** on the flawed repo
- Score = true positives − misclassified · live scoreboard

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" semgrep/semgrep semgrep --config p/default /src
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo" zricethezav/gitleaks:latest detect -s /repo -v
```

<!-- Explain the game before lab: speed + accuracy. Penalize wild guessing (misclassified subtracts) so they must justify each finding. Mirrors a real bug-bounty triage queue. ~3 min. -->

---

## 🐝 Mini-game — Fuzzing Race

- First team to make the provided target **crash** wins
- One crash → one root-cause note
- Full fuzz→exploit lab returns in **Week 11**

<!-- Quick, fun, instant feedback (it crashes or it doesn't). Sets up W11. If short on time, make this a demo. ~2 min. -->

---

## Lab 2 — deliverable

> 📋 **Worksheet 2** — `labs/week02-sdlc-tooling/worksheet.md` (Part 3) · **kickoff:** `bash scan.sh` (Semgrep + Gitleaks on `./vulnerable-repo`)

- A findings **triage table**: tool, CWE, severity, TP/FP, fix idea
- 3 true positives + 1 false positive (justified)
- 1 fuzzing crash with a one-line root cause
- **+ Audit the AI** and **EiPE / Prompt Problem** (see worksheet)

<!-- The graded output. Remind them to also scan the NoteVault project target (worksheet task) and to do the AI-resilient tasks. Point to scan.sh. -->

---

## Key takeaways

- No single tool finds everything — layer SAST/DAST/SCA/fuzzing
- Triage by CWE + severity; kill the noise
- Fuzzing is the highest-yield bug finder — automate it

<!-- Recap, 3 lines. Cold-call: "name a bug SAST would miss but DAST would catch." ~2 min. -->

# Questions?
Next week: Cryptography used correctly

<!-- Cliffhanger: "Next week we break crypto — crack passwords and decrypt a secret in minutes." Remind: scanners ready in their VM. -->
