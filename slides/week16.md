# Week 16
## Capstone Studio & CTF Warm-up
Software Security · Nutthakorn Chalaemwongwan

<!-- Studio day, not a lecture. Frame: this is the dress rehearsal for the graded Week 19. Goal = every team leaves knowing exactly what to fix. ~2 min. -->

---

## Today

- Work-in-progress capstone demos
- Cross-team peer review
- 🏆 Practice CTF tournament (previews Week 19)

<!-- Roadmap. Time-box: WIP demos + peer review first half, practice CTF second half (300-min block). Keep demos strictly timed so everyone presents. -->

---

## Capstone — what good looks like

- Clear threat model → real vulnerabilities → working fixes
- SBOM + signed artifact
- Security CI pipeline that gates the build
- Story: attack → root cause → fix

<!-- Show the bar before demos so teams self-assess. This = the Week 19 graded rubric (project/README.md). Emphasize the narrative: attack → root cause → fix is what scores. ~4 min. -->

---

## Demo format (today, ungraded)

- 10-min demo + 5-min Q&A
- Show one full attack→fix walkthrough live
- Get peer feedback before the graded Week 19

<!-- Run on a timer (15 min/team). "Ungraded" lowers stakes so they expose weak spots now. Insist on a LIVE walkthrough, not slides about it. -->

---

## Peer review rubric

- Is the threat model complete?
- Are findings CWE/OWASP-mapped & reproduced?
- Do the fixes actually close the bug?
- Is the pipeline real (fails on findings)?

<!-- Hand each team this as a checklist to score the team presenting (use scrimmage.md). Peer feedback in writing → the presenting team gets a punch-list. This is the main value of the session. -->

---

## 🏆 Practice CTF

- Mixed web / API / supply-chain / LLM / binary
- Cross-team scrimmage
- Dry run for the Week 19 tournament

<!-- Run the scrimmage (scrimmage.md / item-bank CTF pool) in the exact W19 team format so the final has no surprises. Leaderboard on CTFd. ~2.5 h. -->

---

## Before Week 19

- Fix gaps peers flagged
- Finalize SBOM + signing + pipeline
- Rehearse the demo

<!-- Send them off with a concrete punch-list (the peer feedback). Remind: W19 demo is graded + the final CTF tournament. -->

---

# Next: pre-final review (Week 17)
Then the final — Wk 18 written · Wk 19 capstone CTF

<!-- Bridge to W17 review. Confirm project repos are runnable before the final. -->
