# Week 19
## Final — Capstone CTF + Project Demos
The grand finale

<!-- The finale — make it celebratory + high-energy. Before class: graded flags for challenges 1–6 and 11 come from each student's own hosted instance (confirm everyone can log in and reach one); bring up the local targets for 7–10 and 12, open CTFd, set the demo schedule. Confirm projects run. ~2 min. -->

---

## Two parts

1. 🏆 **Capstone CTF tournament** — whole-term, team-based
2. 🎤 **Final project demos** — graded

<!-- Time-box the 240-min block: CTF tournament first (energy), then graded demos. Tell teams their demo slot up front. -->

---

## 🏆 CTF tournament

- Web · API · supply chain · cloud · memory safety · LLM/agentic
- Team leaderboard, prizes — the **live CTFd board** (bigger, includes bonus/boss challenges)
- **Graded score** comes from the paper trail: flag/proof + payload + one-line mitigation per challenge

<!-- Run from ctf.md (graded, 12 challenges/150 pts) + exams/item-bank.md (CTF pool, incl. the boss chain). CTFd's live board runs more challenges at different point values for engagement/leaderboard — that scoreboard is NOT the grade; ctf.md's submission is. Dynamic scoring + first-blood bonus on CTFd; announce first-bloods aloud for hype. Prizes for top Houses. -->

## 🎤 Final project demo (graded)

Present your secured build end-to-end:

- Threat model → vulnerabilities → remediation
- SBOM + signed artifact
- Security CI/CD pipeline
- **Submit a recorded video walkthrough before the session** — graded asynchronously on the rubric
- **3-min live Q&A** per team on the day (not a live demo slot)

<!-- Format change (2026-07-26): with N≈80–120 students in teams of 2–3, a 10-min-demo+5-min-Q&A live format needs far more than the 90 minutes this block has — it cannot physically run. Video is graded beforehand on the project rubric (project/README.md) + peer-contribution multiplier; the live slot is a short viva-style Q&A only, to confirm the work is theirs — not a re-demo. -->

---

## Bring

- **Video walkthrough submitted before the session**
- Threat model + vuln report (CWE/OWASP mapped)
- Fixed code, SBOM, signed artifact, CI pipeline

<!-- Checklist — anything missing costs rubric points. Confirm the CI pipeline actually fails on a finding (don't take their word; have them show it in the video). -->

# Thank you
You can now threat-model, break, fix, and ship secure software.

<!-- Close the term: name the arc (threat-model → break → fix → ship). Point to next steps (OWASP, CTFs, the readings). For the research: post-test + post-survey happen now (per the study timeline). Celebrate. -->
