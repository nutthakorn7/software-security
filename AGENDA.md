# Weekly Agenda & Time Plan (DRAFT for review)

**Standard contact time:** 5 hrs/week = **120 min lecture + 180 min lab** (per syllabus: 2 lecture + 3 lab hrs).
**Quizzes:** a short **weekly quiz (~10 min) at the start of every teaching week** (retrieval
practice, low-stakes, drop lowest 1–2). Two **cumulative review quizzes** (25 pts) run in the
review weeks (W7 pre-midterm, W17 pre-final).

## Standard teaching-week template (Weeks 1–6, 10–15)

### Lecture — 120 min
| Time | Block |
|------|-------|
| 0:00–0:10 | **Weekly quiz** (retrieval) + recap + today's agenda |
| 0:10–0:55 | Core concepts |
| 0:55–1:05 | Break |
| 1:05–1:35 | Vulnerability deep-dive + real-world cases |
| 1:35–1:55 | Defenses / secure coding |
| 1:55–2:00 | Signature-game briefing → to lab |

### Lab — 180 min
| Time | Block |
|------|-------|
| 0:00–0:15 | Onboarding: stand up target (`docker compose up`), confirm it runs |
| 0:15–1:45 | Exploitation tasks (the signature game) — ~4–5 tasks |
| 1:45–2:25 | Defend / fix task (apply the secure version, prove exploit fails) |
| 2:25–2:45 | **AI-resilient tasks:** Audit-the-AI + EiPE + Prompt Problem (start in class, finish as homework) |
| 2:45–2:55 | **Rotating micro-demo:** 2–3 students give a 2–3 min "show your exploit/fix" (different students each week → everyone presents ~1–2× per term) |
| 2:55–3:00 | Submit worksheet (PDF → Classroom) + push fix (GitHub) + wrap-up |

> **No formal weekly presentation** (impossible for N≈80–120 in the time budget). Instead,
> "explain it live" is delivered by the **rotating micro-demo** above + random **viva spot-checks**
> (2–3 students reproduce/explain their own work) — which also double as anti-AI controls.
> Full presentations are reserved for the **capstone** (W16 WIP + W19 demo).
>
> **Every teaching week's worksheet** has four graded parts beyond the lab tasks:
> **Evidence & Integrity** (identity-stamped proof), **Audit the AI** (critique an AI answer),
> **Explain-in-Plain-English** + **Prompt Problem**. The live **CTFd / Houses scoreboard**
> (if running) is shown at the start/end of class.

> The **weekly quiz** is the first ~10 min of the lecture block (every teaching week) — no
> separate session needed. The two **cumulative review quizzes** run in the review weeks (7, 17).

## ⚠️ Note (drift to resolve)
Current `worksheet.md` Part-3 durations vary (90–180 min). This plan standardizes **lab = 180 min** for every teaching week. Weeks 1–3 worksheets are currently lighter (~90–95 min of tasks) and would need a few more tasks / extension activities to fill the 180-min block.
