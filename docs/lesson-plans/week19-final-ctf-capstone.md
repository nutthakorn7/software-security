# Lesson Plan — Week 19: Final — Capstone CTF Tournament + Project Demos

| | |
|---|---|
| **Course** | Software Security (⬚ course code) |
| **Week / date** | 19 · ⬚ |
| **Contact time** | 240 min — a single final block: **150 min capstone CTF + 90 min graded project demos**. No lecture, no lab (`AGENDA.md`, *Week 19 — Final CTF + project demos (240 min)*) |
| **Lab folder** | `labs/week19-final-ctf-capstone` — holds `README.md` and `ctf.md` (the student paper); it ships no target of its own |
| **Slides** | `slides/week19.md` — proctor/compère deck, not a teaching deck |
| **Covers** | The whole term (`ctf.md`, *Covers*): web, API, supply chain, cloud, memory safety and LLM/agentic challenges (`labs/week19-final-ctf-capstone/README.md`) |

## 1. Session objectives

This is an assessment, not a teaching session. It carries **two separate instruments in one room** —
a team CTF and a graded team demo — and they feed two different gradebook columns (§5). What the
sitting is designed to evidence:

**Knowledge (K)**
- K1 — For each challenge solved, state in one line the control that would have prevented it
  (`ctf.md` requires a **mitigation** column per challenge).
- K2 — Recognise which vulnerability class a target's behaviour belongs to across the *whole* term,
  without task scaffolding: `ctf.md` states only a title, a topic and the source week.
- K3 — For the demo: name each finding's **CWE** and **OWASP Top 10:2025** (or API / LLM Top 10)
  category and its root cause (`project/README.md`, deliverable 2; `labs/week16-capstone/worksheet.md` Part 3 B).

**Skills (P)**
- P1 — Web half: SQLi login, command injection, stored XSS (challenges 1–3, targets W4/W5).
- P2 — Identity and access: IDOR, forging a JWT to admin, BOLA + mass assignment (challenges 4–6,
  targets W6/W10).
- P3 — Binary half: stack overflow → `win()` ret2win, and crashing the binary with a fuzzer
  (challenges 7–8, target W11).
- P4 — Build and platform: find the vulnerable dep / unsigned image; exposed secret / `*:*` IAM /
  root Dockerfile (challenges 9–10, targets W12/W13).
- P5 — LLM: prompt injection → leak the secret; indirect injection / output XSS (challenges 11–12,
  target W14).
- P6 — Record, per challenge, the **flag (or noted proof)**, the **payload/command** and a
  **one-line mitigation** — the three columns of `ctf.md`'s submission table.
- P7 — Present a secured build end to end: threat model → vulnerabilities found → remediation;
  SBOM + signed artifact; security CI/CD pipeline; **a pre-recorded video walkthrough submitted
  before the session, plus a 3-minute live Q&A** (`labs/week19-final-ctf-capstone/README.md`).

**Attitude (A)**
- A1 — Attack only the provided targets, under [ETHICS.md](../../ETHICS.md) (`ctf.md`, *Rules*).
- A2 — One submission per team per challenge; document the method (`ctf.md`, *Rules*).
- A3 — Answer unscripted follow-up questions on the team's own work at the demo — a live viva check
  (`project/README.md`, deliverable 6).

## 2. What is assessed

### 2.1 The tournament — 12 challenges, 150 points, 150 minutes, team-based

Titles, topics and points exactly as printed in `ctf.md`. Each challenge is independent — a target
that will not start costs the team that challenge, not the paper.

| # | Title | Topic / target | Pts |
|---|---|---|---:|
| 1 | **Boolean Bypass** | SQLi login (week04) | 10 |
| 2 | **Shell Out** | command injection (week04) | 15 |
| 3 | **Persistent Pop** | stored XSS (week05) | 10 |
| 4 | **Not Your Object** | IDOR (week06) | 10 |
| 5 | **Token Smith** | forge JWT to admin (week06) | 15 |
| 6 | **Raid the API** | BOLA + mass assignment (week10) | 15 |
| 7 | **Smash** | stack overflow → `win()` ret2win (week11) | 20 |
| 8 | **Fuzz First** | crash the binary with a fuzzer (week11) | 10 |
| 9 | **Bad Dependency** | find the vulnerable dep / unsigned image (week12) | 10 |
| 10 | **Misconfig Hunt** | exposed secret / `*:*` IAM / root Dockerfile (week13) | 15 |
| 11 | **Jailbreak the Bot** | prompt injection → leak the secret (week14) | 10 |
| 12 | **Indirect Hit** | indirect injection / output XSS (week14) | 10 |

`ctf.md` adds: *"Difficulty rises with points"*, and *"First-blood bonus at instructor's discretion."*

### 2.2 The demo — graded separately

Each team presents its secured build: threat model → vulnerabilities found → remediation; SBOM +
signed artifact; security CI/CD pipeline. **Format (graded):** each team submits a pre-recorded
video walkthrough **before the session** (graded asynchronously against the project rubric), and
the in-class slot is a **3-minute live Q&A** — a viva check, not a re-demo
(`labs/week19-final-ctf-capstone/README.md`; `AGENDA.md` §*Week 19*). `ctf.md` line 6 says the demo
*"is scored separately"* and links the rubric — see the cross-reference defect noted in §5.

**CLO coverage.** Challenges 1–12 evidence **CLO2**; the per-challenge mitigation line is the
**CLO3** evidence available inside a 150-minute tournament (there is no defend-and-re-test task, as
there is in a teaching week). The demo carries **CLO3** (remediation shown and re-tested) and
**CLO5** (communicating a finding, its impact and its fix, plus the Q&A). Per-student flags,
identity-stamped evidence and the live viva carry **CLO6**.

## 3. Preparation and infrastructure readiness

### 3.1 What this sitting actually runs on

- **Graded flags come from the hosted platform (challenges 1–6 and 11).** Each student spawns their
  **own** instance of these challenges in the course's hosted CTFd (`ctf.zcr.ai`, container-spawning
  plugin). The platform issues that student a flag per challenge — an HMAC of student ID + challenge
  key with the cohort salt (`airsec_flag_bridge`) — so a flag can be traced to the student it was
  issued to and cannot be read off the student's own machine. Challenge 6 is two hosted images
  (`w10-bola`, `w10-massassign`). The hosted instances are reached over the network, so solving them
  depends on it (§3.3, §9). How the members of a team spawn instances and which flag the team
  submits: ⬚ (§3.3).
- **Challenges 7–10 and 12 have no hosted instance.** They run from the local lab folders on the
  student's own machine — "all lab targets run locally in Docker" (course specification §1, §10) —
  and are attributed by evidence and viva, not by flag (§3.2).
- **Local Docker is practice for challenges 1–6 and 11.** With no `.env` the compose files serve
  the public `…_demo` flags. Do **not** plan graded flags around giving each student a per-student
  `.env`: the student owns the machine and the file, so `cat .env` / `docker exec … env` reveals the
  flag before any exploitation.
- **No new target ships this week.** `labs/week19-final-ctf-capstone/` contains only `README.md`
  and `ctf.md`; every challenge points at an existing lab folder or a hosted challenge, and the
  demos run each team's own project repository plus `project/starter-app` (NoteVault).
- **CTFd's scoreboard is engagement, not the grade.** `instructor/CTFd-SETUP.md` is explicit: the
  flags in `instructor/ctfd/challenges.yml` are shared/static placeholders (a `_XXXX` suffix to
  rotate per cohort), and the board is the engagement arena; marks come from the answer key applied
  to the submission of record. Graded integrity uses the per-student flags issued by the hosted
  instances, tabulated and resolved with `seed_flags.py` (§3.2). The course's CTFd is hosted at
  `ctf.zcr.ai`; `CTFd-SETUP.md` §1 documents a local one on `http://localhost:8000`.
- **The two point systems are not the same board.** The paper (`ctf.md`) is 12 challenges / 150 pts
  with fixed values. `challenges.yml` is dynamic (`initial: 500`, `minimum: 100`, `decay: 15`),
  values 200–500, splits "Raid the API" into *"crAPI Raid: BOLA"* and *"crAPI Raid: Mass
  Assignment"*, adds *"Capture the Hash"*, and carries a 15th challenge — *"Boss: Breach NoteVault"*
  — that **is not on the student paper**. (12 paper topics − 1 merged "Raid the API" + 2 split
  BOLA/Mass Assignment + 1 "Capture the Hash" + 1 "Boss" = 15 total `challenges.yml` entries.)
  `slides/week19.md`'s speaker note says to run the tournament "from `ctf.md` + `exams/item-bank.md`
  (CTF pool, incl. the boss chain)". Decide before the day which board students are told is
  authoritative; the graded instrument is the paper.
- **The spawnable platform is in play — for challenges 1–6 and 11.** It is the hosted CTFd and
  `airsec_flag_bridge` flag derivation already used for the 19 Sep 2026 Week 9 sitting, where the
  per-student flags were verified against the issued table (38 of 40 matched; the other 2 came from
  outside the platform).
- **Submission of record.** "W19 Final CTF + demo — flags via Form; live project demo (graded by
  rubric)" ([SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md), *Exams*). `ctf.md`'s own submission table is the
  paper form of the same three columns.

### 3.2 Per-student flags — hosted platform, and where it does not reach

The instructor-side tooling is still used for the **table and for attribution at marking** (the hosted
platform derives its flags from the same salt, so `verify` resolves them). It is **not** how students
get graded flags: students never had `instructor/`, and a `.env` in a student's own copy is readable
by that student.

```bash
export FLAG_SALT='<this cohort's salt — never published>'   # instructor/anti-cheating.md §A
python3 instructor/seed_flags.py gen students.txt -o flags.csv     # authoritative table
python3 instructor/seed_flags.py verify 'FLAG{...}' students.txt   # who was this issued to?
```

`instructor/seed_flags.py` is a shim: it forwards `FLAG_SALT` to `SWSEC_FLAG_SALT` and requires the
sibling `KOSEN69 - curriculum` monorepo — without it, it exits with
`ERROR: curriculum monorepo not found at …` and generates nothing. The challenge-key vocabulary now
comes from that monorepo's `courses/software-security.yml`.

**Which of the twelve have a hosted, per-student instance** (challenge titles as on the paper; the
hosted images are the platform's spawnable challenges):

| # | Challenge | Flag key | Hosted image | Attributable per student? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Boolean Bypass | `sqli` | `w04-sqli` | **Yes** — hosted instance |
| 2 | Shell Out | `cmdi` | `w04-cmdi` | **Yes** — hosted instance |
| 3 | Persistent Pop | `xss` | `w05-xss` | **Yes** — hosted instance (the local `labs/week05-xss-client-side` compose has *no* `environment:` block and never served per-student flags) |
| 4 | Not Your Object | `idor` | `w06-idor` | **Yes** — hosted instance |
| 5 | Token Smith | `jwt` | `w06-jwt` | **Yes** — hosted instance |
| 6 | Raid the API | `bola`, `massassign` | `w10-bola`, `w10-massassign` | **Yes** — hosted instance |
| 7 | Smash | `pwn` | — none — | **No** — `vuln.c:47` reads `getenv("FLAG_PWN")`, but W11 ships **no compose** and students `make` and run it themselves, so any value they are told to export is theirs to read |
| 8 | Fuzz First | `fuzz` | — none — | **No** — no target env at all |
| 9 | Bad Dependency | `supplychain` | — none — | **No** — W12 is scripts + Dockerfile, no compose, no env |
| 10 | Misconfig Hunt | `misconfig` | — none — | **No** — W13 is Dockerfiles + IAM JSON, no compose, no env |
| 11 | Jailbreak the Bot | `promptinj` | `w14-promptinj` | **Yes** — hosted instance |
| 12 | Indirect Hit | `indirect` | — none — | **No** — no target env |

The course manifest lists `xss`, `crack`, `ecb`, `fuzz`, `supplychain`, `misconfig`, `indirect` and
`boss` under `extra_challenge_keys`, described there as *"Static/manually-graded CTFd-only challenges
with no attributable per-lesson lab"*. Read that as a statement about the **local** labs: `xss`
(`w05-xss`), `ecb` (`w03-ecb`) and `boss` (`notevault`) have hosted instances — only `xss` is on this
paper — while `fuzz`, `supplychain`, `misconfig`, `indirect` — and `pwn` — do not. So **seven of twelve challenges (1–6 and 11) are attributable per student through hosted
instances, and five (7, 8, 9, 10, 12) are not.** Plan the five's attribution around
identity-stamped evidence, the method note and the viva (§6) — not around the flag. The seven are
attributable per *student*, not per team: which member's flag a team submits is ⬚ (§3.3).

**Pre-flight (the day before).** Spawn each hosted challenge on the paper (1–6 and 11 — eight images,
since challenge 6 is two) once as a test student and check that the flag it returns resolves with
`seed_flags.py verify` **using the same salt** (§3.4).

**The local copies serve demo flags — practice only.** In the four local folders below, with no `.env`
present, `docker compose config` renders `null` (checked):

```
labs/week04-injection        FLAG_CMDI: null        FLAG_SQLI: null
labs/week06-authn-authz      FLAG_IDOR: null        FLAG_JWT: null
labs/week10-api-security     FLAG_BOLA: null        FLAG_MASSASSIGN: null
labs/week14-ai-llm-security  FLAG_PROMPTINJ: null   (both services)
```

The variable then never reaches the container and the app serves the placeholder committed in its
source. That is the intended practice behaviour, not something to fix. W4/W6/W10 fall back to a
`_demo`-suffixed `FLAG{...}` value; W14 instead falls back to the fixed placeholder
`FLAG{pr0mpt_1nj3ction_l34ks_s3cr3ts}` (`vulnerable_chatbot.py`, `guarded_chatbot.py`) — check
`docker compose config` for `FLAG_PROMPTINJ: null` rather than relying on the string shape for that
one. **A demo/placeholder flag arriving on a submission sheet means the student worked on a local
copy, not that the team cheated** — it is public, so it proves nothing either way; ask which
instance they used before anything else.

### 3.3 Teams, room, network, machines

- **Which team unit competes is not recorded.** `ctf.md` says only "Team-based". The Week 16
  scrimmage that previews it says "Teams of 2–4" (`labs/week16-capstone/scrimmage.md`). Project
  teams are 2–3 (`project/README.md`). `instructor/CTFd-SETUP.md` §5 is explicit that "the graded
  project teams of 2–3 are *not* CTFd teams … CTFd's single team layer **is** the House". Fix and
  announce the competing unit before the day: ⬚. It determines which members spawn hosted instances
  and whose flag a team submits for each challenge (the platform issues flags per student — ⬚ how a
  team handles that), and how one team score is entered against several students (§5).
- **Sharing inside a team is permitted; per-student flags therefore detect *cross-team* sharing
  only.** This is the opposite of the Week 9 individual sitting and changes what §6 can promise.
- Room / seating / invigilator count / demo room(s): ⬚ (not recorded in this repository).
- Students work on their own machines; "phones away; one device" (`instructor/anti-cheating.md` §C).
- Network is needed **throughout** for the hosted challenges (1–6 and 11): the instances are reached
  over it, as is the submission Form. Have every student log in to CTFd and spawn a first instance
  **before the clock starts** (§4). It is also needed for image pulls and `pip install` at start-up
  of the local copies, Trivy's vulnerability database and Cosign's OIDC flow.
- The class size the timetable assumes is N≈80–120 (`AGENDA.md`) — see the demo-throughput
  arithmetic in §9, which needs a decision *before* the day.

### 3.4 Test the day before

- [ ] **Team unit fixed and announced** (§3.3), and how a team submits flags issued to individual
      students decided and recorded: ⬚.
- [ ] **Hosted platform up for the cohort.** Every student has a CTFd account and can spawn and
      reach an instance (connection steps: ⬚); each hosted challenge on the paper (1–6 and 11)
      spawns (§3.2 pre-flight). A shared instance that issues one flag to everyone makes the
      per-student flags decorative.
- [ ] Local copies — practice, and the targets for challenges 7–10 and 12: `docker pull
      python:3.12-slim`, the base image W4, W5, W6, W10 and W14 all use.
- [ ] Local copies, if used: bring each web target up **once, one at a time** (they collide on
      8080 — §9) and confirm it answers: W4, W5, W6 and W10's `vulnerable-api` on
      `http://localhost:8080`; W10's `solution-api` on `http://localhost:8081`; W14's chatbots on
      `http://localhost:8082` and `http://localhost:8083`. They serve `…_demo` flags and are **not**
      graded targets for challenges 1–6 and 11.
- [ ] `python3 instructor/seed_flags.py verify '<flag a hosted instance issued to a test student>'
      students.txt` resolves to the right student, **using the same salt** that `gen` ran with. Run
      `gen` the day before, not on the morning — the shim needs the sibling monorepo (§3.2).
- [ ] `python3 instructor/check_flag_keys.py` exits 0 (flag-key vocabulary in sync across the
      manifest, the deployment whitelist, the challenge CSV and `ctfd/challenges.yml`).
- [ ] **W11 builds on the machines in the room.** `make` in `labs/week11-memory-safety-exploitation`
      produces `vuln` and `vuln-hardened`; the Makefile's own note says `-z execstack` and `-no-pie`
      are GNU ld / Linux flags and "On macOS the *link* step of these targets may fail". Have the
      toolbox image built (`docker build -t softsec-toolbox labs/toolbox`) and the run line ready —
      it is the documented escape hatch, since "Apple clang ships no libFuzzer runtime, and `gdb` is
      painful on macOS" (`labs/toolbox/README.md`). Delete `vuln`, `vuln-*` and `fuzz` afterwards.
- [ ] **W12/W13 tool pulls.** `bash sca_scan.sh` and `bash sign.sh` (W12) and `bash scan.sh` (W13)
      run `aquasec/trivy:latest` in throwaway containers and mount the Docker socket; Trivy also
      needs to fetch its database. Pull the image and warm the DB before the room does.
- [ ] **Cosign is not an offline step.** `sign.sh`'s own note: "keyless signing needs a browser/OIDC
      flow and registry push access; in class this is a guided demo, not an offline step". Do not
      make a challenge or a demo depend on live signing succeeding in the room.
- [ ] CTFd (`ctf.zcr.ai`) up, challenges imported with this cohort's rotated flag suffixes,
      dynamic scoring and first-blood on, scoreboard **frozen** for the window
      (`CTFd-SETUP.md` §3–§4).
- [ ] Submission Form open/close times set, with the settings from `instructor/anti-cheating.md` §C
      (restrict to the cohort's accounts, collect email, one response, auto-close).
- [ ] **Video-submission deadline and Q&A schedule published to teams in advance** —
      `slides/week19.md`: "Tell teams their demo slot up front"; each team's **3-minute live Q&A**
      slot follows submission of its pre-recorded video walkthrough before the session.
- [ ] The Week 16 scrimmage and the Week 17 mock CTF have been run — both state they are the same
      format as this tournament (`labs/week16-capstone/scrimmage.md`,
      `labs/week17-review-final-prep/mock-ctf.md`).
- [ ] Projector/display for the leaderboard and the demos: ⬚.

## 4. Run of show — the 240-minute block

Timings are `AGENDA.md`'s (*Week 19 — Final CTF + project demos*): `0:00–2:30` capstone CTF
tournament, `2:30–4:00` graded final project demos.

| Time | Block | Instructor does | Students do |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0:00–0:10 *(inside the 150)* | **Briefing + target check** | Run `slides/week19.md`: the two parts, the 150-minute window, the submit format (flag/proof + payload/command + one-line mitigation), the rules (provided targets only, one submission per team per challenge, document method), that graded flags for challenges 1–6 and 11 are per-student and come only from **your own hosted instance** (a local run serves demo flags, which are not graded flags) and copying across teams is traceable, and, for local copies, the **port-8080 warning** (below). Confirm everyone can log in to CTFd and reach a spawned instance, and that Docker / `make` works for the local-only challenges | Log in and spawn the hosted instances they need; stand up the local targets; report anything that will not start or connect **now**, not at 1:00 |
| 0:10–2:30 | **Competition window** | Invigilate; answer environment questions only, not challenge questions; announce first bloods aloud for hype (`slides/week19.md`); watch for demo/placeholder flags — a student on a local copy (§3.2) | Solve challenges 1–12 in any order; fill the three columns per challenge as they go |
| 2:30 | **Submission cutoff** | Close the Form / collect the paper tables | Submit flags + payload/command + one-line mitigation |
| 2:30–4:00 | **Graded live Q&A** | Each team gets a **3-minute live Q&A** slot; ask one or two unscripted probing questions ("why this fix and not X?", "what does this SBOM line mean?") — the built-in viva (`anti-cheating.md` §D). Confirm the CI pipeline failing on a finding was shown in the submitted video (`slides/week19.md`) rather than re-demoing it live | Per team: answer the live Q&A on the video already submitted **before** the session (graded asynchronously on the project rubric) — not a re-demo, per `labs/week19-final-ctf-capstone/README.md` |

**Port warning to give in the briefing (local copies only).** `labs/week04-injection`,
`labs/week05-xss-client-side`, `labs/week06-authn-authz`, `labs/week10-api-security`
(`vulnerable-api`) and `project/starter-app` **all publish host port 8080**. Anyone running several
local copies at once will hit it. How hosted instances are addressed, and whether they can collide
with these: ⬚. See §9 for the fix.

**Two demands competing for the same 240 minutes, both real:**
1. `slides/week19.md`'s closing note records that the research **post-test + post-survey happen
   now** (`instructor/research/`; the post-test is 20 MCQ + 2 applied items). No slot for it exists
   in `AGENDA.md`'s 240 minutes; duration and placement: ⬚.
2. Even at 3 minutes/team the live Q&A block may not fit the largest cohorts — resolve before the
   day (§9).

## 5. Scoring — how points become marks

| Step | Rule | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Per challenge | Flag/proof + payload/command + one-line mitigation = full points | `ctf.md` (submission requirement) |
| Paper total | **150 pts** across 12 challenges (values 10–20) | `ctf.md` |
| First blood | Bonus "at instructor's discretion" | `ctf.md`, *Rules* |
| Into the gradebook (CTF) | **Final % = average** of the W18 written and the W19 CTF | `instructor/GRADEBOOK.md` |
| Into the final mark (CTF) | Final block = **25%** — so this tournament carries half of it | `syllabus.md` §6; course specification §4 |
| Into the gradebook (demo) | **Project % = min(100, rubric × peer multiplier)**, multiplier 0.8–1.1 | `instructor/GRADEBOOK.md`; `project/README.md` |
| Into the final mark (demo) | Term project = **15%**, team-graded, per-member scaled | `syllabus.md` §6 |
| Normalisation | Classroom import maps `grade ÷ maxPoints × 100` | `instructor/GRADEBOOK.md` |

**Which demo rubric.** Two 100-point rubrics exist and they are not identical: `project/README.md`
(threat model 20 / findings 25 / remediation 25 / supply chain 15 / CI 10 / presentation 5) and
`labs/week16-capstone/worksheet.md` (threat model 15 / exploitation 20 / remediation 20 / SBOM +
signing 15 / CI 15 / demo & Q&A 15), plus that worksheet's own 1–5 peer-review rubric. The second
one grades the **Week 16 studio worksheet itself** — `project/README.md` calls that studio demo
"WIP, ungraded." `instructor/GRADEBOOK.md` names **`project/README.md`'s** as *the* project rubric —
the one that actually scores the Week 19 graded demo — and `syllabus.md` / `syllabus-mfu.md` publish
the identical 100-pt table under "Term project rubric." `ctf.md` line 6 now links there
(`../../project/README.md`) instead of to `labs/week16-capstone/worksheet.md`: an earlier revision
pointed it at the worksheet and rationalized the choice as giving readers a "dual-rubric comparison"
and the project checklist, but the worksheet itself contains no such comparison (only this lesson
plan does, and this lesson plan isn't student-facing) — so that link sent students to a *different*,
differently-weighted rubric for a *different*, explicitly-ungraded deliverable.
`labs/week16-capstone/worksheet.md` Part 3 A still holds the deliverables checklist for anyone who
wants it; `ctf.md` just no longer sends the "what am I graded on" reader there.

**Individual vs team.** Both instruments in this session are team-graded, which is unusual for this
course: individual work is ~75% of the mark (course specification §8), and the bounded team
components are the project (15%) and this capstone CTF. Two consequences to settle:

- **One team score, several students.** Whatever the CTF team unit turns out to be (§3.3), the CTF
  score is entered per student in the *Final written / CTF* column. Whether a team's CTF score is
  differentiated between members at all: ⬚.
- **Does the peer multiplier touch the CTF?** Course specification §8 reads "Team-graded work is
  bounded: the term project (15%) and the Week 19 capstone CTF, with each project member's mark
  scaled by a peer-contribution evaluation", which can be read either way.
  `instructor/GRADEBOOK.md` applies the 0.8–1.1 multiplier to the **Project** column only. Flagged,
  not resolved: ⬚.
- **First blood can exceed the maximum.** A bonus on top of 150 collides with `grade ÷ maxPoints ×
  100`. Cap it, or record the bonus as CTFd participation instead: ⬚.
- The Houses / CTFd leaderboard remains **non-graded engagement** (`syllabus.md`, *Teams & Houses*;
  course specification §7) and feeds only the *Participation %* column. Nothing else from the
  scoreboard is transcribed into the gradebook.

**Make-up sittings.** `instructor/exams/` holds a parallel **Form B for the written papers only**
(W8 and W18); there is no Form B for a practical. The rotation pool is `instructor/exams/item-bank.md`.
Absence / make-up / late policy for an exam sitting: ⬚ (institutional). The general late rule
(−10%/day, up to 3 days) is `syllabus.md` §6.

## 6. Academic-integrity controls actually used

| Control | How it is operated | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| **Per-student flags (hosted instances)** | Issued by the hosted platform to the student who spawned the instance; `seed_flags.py gen` before the day, `verify '<flag>' students.txt` at marking | A flag submitted by one team but *issued* to a student on another — reaches challenges 1–6 and 11 only (§3.2) |
| **Per-team NoteVault marker** | `TEAM_ID` seeds an `hmac(TEAM_SALT, TEAM_ID)`-derived marker into the app's own data (`project/starter-app/README.md`; `anti-cheating.md` §A) | A demo, report or screenshot carrying another team's marker |
| **Identity-stamped evidence** | Screenshots must carry the student's terminal `whoami` / login email / student ID **and** a timestamp | Borrowed or generic screenshots (`anti-cheating.md` §B) |
| **Method note per challenge** | The payload/command + mitigation columns of `ctf.md` | A flag held without the mechanism; also the basis for partial credit |
| **Live viva at the demo** | One or two unscripted questions per team, scored as part of Q&A | A team that copied a report or a fix and cannot improvise on it (`project/README.md`; `anti-cheating.md` §D) |
| **Similarity checking** | The same MOSS/JPlag pass used on weekly forks, run on **team project repos** at the Week 19 milestone — report PDFs through MOSS's plain-text mode too | Verbatim copying between teams (`anti-cheating.md` §B) |
| **Scoreboard freeze** | CTFd → Settings → Freeze time for the window | Progress leaking between teams mid-sitting (`CTFd-SETUP.md` §4) |
| **Dynamic scoring + first blood** | Already configured (`initial: 500`, `minimum: 100`, `decay: 15`) | Reduces the incentive to pool answers (`anti-cheating.md` §C) |
| **Rotation each cohort** | New `FLAG_SALT`, new data seeds, new CTFd flag suffixes, at least one target changed per topic | Last year's flag dump (`anti-cheating.md` §E; `CTFd-SETUP.md` §7) |

**Known limits, so they are covered deliberately rather than assumed away:**

- **Sharing within a team is allowed** — that is what "team-based" means. Per-student flags here
  prove *which team* a flag reached, not which student typed it. Individual mastery is evidenced
  elsewhere in the course (worksheets, quizzes, W8/W9/W18), not by this tournament.
- **Challenges 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 have no hosted instance and carry no per-student flag** (§3.2).
  Their attribution rests on identity-stamped evidence, the method note and the demo viva — weight
  the spot-checks towards them.
- A `…_demo` / placeholder flag means the student worked on a **local copy**, not that they cheated
  (§3.2). It is public, so it proves nothing either way; ask which instance they used before
  accusing anyone. How a demo flag is scored: ⬚.
- `verify` only resolves flags generated with the **same salt**; a salt mismatch looks like an
  unattributable flag.
- A flag `verify` attributes to another team's member does not by itself say *how* it got there, and
  an unmatched flag does not either: at the 19 Sep 2026 Week 9 sitting 38 of 40 flags matched the
  issued table and the other 2 came from outside the platform. Ask the teams involved before
  deciding.
- For the challenges with no hosted instance, CTFd's own flags are **shared and static** by design
  (`CTFd-SETUP.md`) — a matching CTFd flag proves nothing about authorship.
- Red flags to carry into marking (`anti-cheating.md` §F): identical screenshots across teams, a
  flag `verify` attributes to another team's member, a NoteVault marker that resolves to a different
  team, code that appears fully formed in one commit with no history, prose that does not match the
  team's own data seed.
- If copying is found: [ETHICS.md](../../ETHICS.md) + the conduct process; keep the `verify` output,
  the MOSS report and the commit log as evidence (`anti-cheating.md` §G).

## 7. After the session — debrief and how results feed the final mark

- **Debrief.** `AGENDA.md` allocates no debrief inside the 240 minutes, and this is the last week of
  term — there is no following session to borrow an opening block from, as Week 9 borrows Week 10's.
  What `slides/week19.md` closes with instead: name the arc (threat-model → break → fix → ship),
  point to next steps (OWASP, CTFs, the readings), and celebrate. Where a real
  post-mortem/results debrief happens, if at all: ⬚.
- **Marking.** Keys are instructor-only and git-ignored:
  `instructor/exams/week19-final-ctf-capstone-ctf-answers.md` for the tournament; the project rubric
  in `project/README.md` for the demo. Never copy any key content into this repository's public files.
- **Into the mark.** Enter the CTF score under *Final written / CTF*; the sheet recomputes **Final % =
  average** of W18 and W19 (`instructor/GRADEBOOK.md`), and Final is **25%** of the mark. Enter the
  demo score under *Project rubric*, then each member's **peer multiplier** (0.8–1.1); Project % =
  min(100, rubric × multiplier) and Project is **15%**. `gradebook_sync.gs` pulls Classroom and CTFd
  automatically; the subjective rubric scores are graded once in Classroom and synced.
- **Term close-out.** Read **FINAL %** + **Letter** from the Master Sheet, export a PDF/CSV
  snapshot, and enter the official grade into the institutional system (`instructor/GRADEBOOK.md`).
  Grading scale: ⬚ (institutional; the template's default bands are editable on its *Scale* sheet).
- **Outcome attainment.** Map the assessment scores back to the CLO table in course specification §4
  (§9 of that document).
- **Into next time.** A challenge nobody solved, or everybody solved, is an item-bank note
  (`instructor/exams/item-bank.md`).

## 9. Risks and contingencies

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **The demo block does not fit the largest cohorts.** `AGENDA.md` gives 90 min (2:30–4:00); a strict live 10-min-demo + 5-min-Q&A format would be **15 min/team → 6 slots**, which cannot seat the ~27–60 teams N≈80–120 (`AGENDA.md`) implies in teams of 2–3 | **Resolved by `AGENDA.md`:** each team submits a pre-recorded video walkthrough before the session (graded asynchronously on the project rubric), and the in-class block is a **3-minute live Q&A per team**, which fits ~30 teams in 90 min. Above ~30 teams: run parallel rooms with a second assessor, or split the Q&A across the Week 16 studio and Week 19 (`AGENDA.md` §*Week 19*) |
| **Five-way port-8080 collision (local copies).** W4, W5, W6, W10 (`vulnerable-api`) and `project/starter-app` all publish 8080; a team running several local copies at once hits it | Brief at 0:00–0:10: `docker compose down` one before the next, or override the **left** side of the ports mapping. The Flask apps listen on 5000 *inside* the W4/W5/W6/W10 containers — do not republish 5000 (macOS AirPlay squats 5000, not 8080). W10's `solution-api` already takes 8081; W14 uses 8082/8083; a local CTFd, if run, uses 8000 |
| **Burp on its default listener.** The Week 6 worksheet's optional Burp step proxies through `127.0.0.1:8080` — the same port the targets publish | Move either Burp's listener or the target's published port |
| **Student works on a local copy → demo flag.** Verified: with no `.env`, compose renders `FLAG_*: null` in all four local labs (W4, W6, W10, W14) and the app falls back to its committed placeholder | Brief it at 0:00: graded flags for 1–6 and 11 come only from your own hosted instance. Treat a placeholder flag on a sheet as "worked locally", not as cheating; ask which instance was used. Do not try to fix it by seeding per-student `.env` files — the student owns the file |
| **`seed_flags.py` cannot find the curriculum monorepo** — the shim `sys.exit`s with `ERROR: curriculum monorepo not found` and generates nothing | Run `gen` the **day before**; the sibling `KOSEN69 - curriculum` directory must be present. `check_flag_keys.py` (same shim pattern) is the cheap pre-flight |
| **Salt mismatch** between `gen` and `verify` — attribution silently returns nothing | Record this cohort's `FLAG_SALT` alongside the `flags.csv` it produced; export the same value before `verify` |
| **W11 will not link on a macOS host.** The Makefile's own note: `-z execstack` and `-no-pie` are GNU ld / Linux flags, so "on macOS the *link* step of these targets may fail"; `make syntax` still works. Apple clang also ships no libFuzzer runtime (`labs/toolbox/README.md`), which is challenge 8 | Have `softsec-toolbox` **built before the day** and the run line on a slide: `docker run -it --rm --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -v "$PWD":/work -w /work softsec-toolbox`. `--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE` + relaxed seccomp are what make `gdb`/ASan work |
| **Challenge 7 has no hosted instance, so its flag cannot be per-student.** `vuln.c:47` reads `FLAG_PWN`, but there is no compose to inject it and students build and run `vuln` themselves — anything they are told to export, they can read | Attribute challenge 7 by evidence and viva like 8/9/10/12; do not ask students to export a per-student `FLAG_PWN` |
| **W12/W13 need the network and the Docker socket.** `sca_scan.sh`, `sign.sh` and `scan.sh` run `aquasec/trivy:latest` with `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`, and Trivy fetches its vulnerability DB | Pre-pull `aquasec/trivy:latest` and warm the DB the day before. A locked-down machine that forbids socket mounts cannot run these — check in the target check, not at 1:00 |
| **Cosign needs a browser OIDC flow and registry push access** — `sign.sh` says so itself, and calls it "a guided demo, not an offline step" in class | Do not gate challenge 9 or a demo on live keyless signing. Accept a previously produced signature + the verification command as the evidence (`week16-capstone/worksheet.md` Part 3 A, deliverable 5) |
| **PyPI reachability at start-up.** W4/W5/W6/W10 `pip install flask` (W6 also `pyjwt`, W14 `flask`) at container start; a whole room starting at once needs the network | Pre-pull `python:3.12-slim`; keep a USB `docker save`/`docker load` copy; use the 0:00–0:10 target check to surface failures before the clock matters |
| **The hosted platform is unavailable, or cannot hold the room.** It spawns challenges 1–6 and 11 and issues their flags; N≈80–120 students (`AGENDA.md`) may all spawn at once (capacity: ⬚) | Local Docker serves demo flags only, so per-student attribution for those seven is lost for that window; challenges 7–10 and 12 are unaffected. Decide the fallback before the day (extend, reschedule, or accept identity-stamped evidence only) and record it: ⬚. The board itself is engagement only; the submission of record is the Form / Classroom ([SUBMISSION.md](../../SUBMISSION.md)), and `ctf.md`'s submission table works on paper |
| **A student or team cannot reach their hosted instance** | Sort it in the 0:00–0:10 target check; how instances are reached, and any spare-machine provision: ⬚ (not recorded in this repository) |
| **The CTFd board and the paper disagree** — different point values, "Raid the API" split in two, an extra "Capture the Hash", and a 15th "Boss: Breach NoteVault" that is not on the paper | Announce at 0:00 which board is graded (the paper is), and either hide the extras or state that they score participation only |
| **NoteVault is not hardened for shared hosting.** `instructor/PLATFORM-ROADMAP.md` records that `project/starter-app/app.py` runs with Flask `debug=True` — an active Werkzeug console — and must be turned off before any lab is baked for shared multi-tenant spawning | Keep NoteVault on the team's own machine for the demo, as the delivery model already assumes; do not stand `project/starter-app` up on a shared host for this session. The platform also hosts a `notevault` Boss image (not on the paper, so a caveat rather than a graded dependency); whether its `debug=True` console was disabled: ⬚ |
| **A team's Docker will not run at all** | No spare-machine provision is recorded in this repository — decide and record it: ⬚ |
| **Build artefacts left behind.** `make` in `labs/week11-memory-safety-exploitation` produces `vuln`, `vuln-*` and `fuzz` | `make clean`, or delete them — the curriculum monorepo's parity gate compares every file in the lab directory |

**If it fails mid-session — decision order**

1. **Network drops.** Local targets that are already up (7, 8, 12) keep working; keep going on those.
   The hosted instances (1–6, 11) are reached over the network and cannot be used without it, and
   challenges 9 and 10 depend on Trivy's DB fetch. Hold submissions and collect `ctf.md`'s table on
   paper at 2:30, transcribe afterwards; note the outage against the affected items for partial
   credit. Whether the window is extended: ⬚.
2. **One target dies for one team.** The twelve challenges are independent — they lose that item's
   points, not the paper. Note it against their sheet.
3. **The Form dies.** The paper table becomes the record; nothing else changes. **If CTFd itself
   dies**, the hosted challenges cannot be spawned or reached — see the hosted-platform row in §9's
   risks table; the paper table is still the record for everything else.
4. **A team's pre-recorded video is missing or will not play.** The pre-recorded format removes
   the live-exploit-fails failure mode from this block — there is no live attack segment left to
   fall back from. A missing/unplayable video is a missing deliverable against `project/README.md`'s
   rubric, not a live-demo contingency; run the 3-minute Q&A anyway on whatever artefacts the team
   can show and record the gap for marking. Exactly how the rubric penalizes a missing video: ⬚.
5. **Widespread failure to start targets or reach the hosted instances inside the first 10
   minutes.** That is exactly what the 0:00–0:10 target check exists to expose. The repository
   defines no fallback adjustment to the 150-minute window, and this is the last session of term so
   there is nothing to postpone into — the decision and its justification are the instructor's, and
   must be recorded: ⬚.

## 10. Post-teaching reflection

*Complete after the session — this also feeds the course's engagement data.*

- Attendance / completion: ⬚
- Time actually taken per block (vs. plan) — did the CTF hold to 150 min and did every team demo: ⬚
- Where the class got stuck, and what unblocked them: ⬚
- Challenge with the lowest solve rate, and what that says about the week it came from: ⬚
- Integrity flags raised by `seed_flags.py verify` / the NoteVault `TEAM_ID` marker, and how each resolved: ⬚
- Anything to change before this week runs again: ⬚
