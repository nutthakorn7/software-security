# Software Security

A modern, hands-on undergraduate course in software security. Every week pairs a lecture concept with a lab in which students either **break** an intentionally vulnerable target in a safe sandbox or **defend** code they write themselves.

Aligned with **OWASP Top 10 (2025)**, **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)**, the **OWASP API Security Top 10**, **MITRE CWE/ATT&CK**, and the **SLSA** supply-chain framework.

> ⚠️ **Ethics first.** All offensive techniques are taught for **defensive and authorized testing only**. Read [ETHICS.md](ETHICS.md) before starting any lab. Attack only the provided sandbox targets or systems you have **explicit written permission** to test.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd software-security
# each lab is self-contained:
cd labs/week01-threat-modeling
cat README.md            # follow the lab guide
docker compose up        # (where a target is provided)
```

**Base requirements:** a Linux VM (Kali/Ubuntu), Docker + Docker Compose, Git, and a browser proxy (Burp Suite Community or OWASP ZAP). See [labs/week01-threat-modeling/README.md](labs/week01-threat-modeling/README.md) for the full "Lab 0" setup.
